## **Labs**
Our Labs are dedicated spaces that provide a range of services to entrepreneurs, innovators, makers, developers and digital creatives through our different programmes. We also host a number of partner events, workshops and trainings within our labs and technology partners can select to run mLab facilitated activities or simply work with our events team to assist with them with setup and arrangements.

## **About us**
mLab is a tech-centred business working alongside partners to build a vibrant, robust innovation ecosystem. We do this by identifying and nurturing the tech-talent among our youth, supporting budding tech-entrepreneurs and their fledgling businesses, and creating tech that brings about change and improves the lives of all South Africans. We also run a number of pan-African programmes to broaden the reach and impact of our participants and stakeholders alike.
