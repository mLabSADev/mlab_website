A great business idea is a good start … but where to from there? mLab specialises in supporting early-stage start-ups through our various accelerator programmes. We have developed significant offerings and competencies over the past decade to deliver a value chain of support to entrepreneurs. We have supported hundreds of start-ups in various sectors such as; Transport, Education, Agriculture, e-Commerce, Health and Professional Services amongst others. They in turn have gone on to win awards, gain exposure to international markets, secure growth funding, create hundreds of jobs, generate millions in revenue and positively impact many of our lives.

This Enterprise Development programme supports early-stage founders of tech-enabled businesses to pursue their next growth opportunity. mLab does this through providing critical support services such as gap analysis, go-to-market strategies, mentorship, grant seed funding as well as assistance with digital tools and development of minimal viable products (MVPs). Beneficiaries also benefit from entrepreneurship focused training, networking events, office space, access to equipment and devices amongst other forms of support.
