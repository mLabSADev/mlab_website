According to the World Bank, more than 230 million jobs will require digital skills in Africa by 2030. Employers are already struggling to find the skills they need to run their businesses. There are many reasons for this but among the reasons is a disjoint between what is traditionally taught and the shifting demand due to emerging technologies. This skills gap is detrimental not only to individual businesses but to economies at large.To bridge the gap, mLab works closely with business partners to ensure its curriculum is closely aligned with business needs. mLab gives young South Africans the skills, experience and confidence to harness the fruit of technology-led prosperity Our skills development initiatives teach technical expertise, as well as business acumen and the soft skills graduates need to succeed in the working world.
