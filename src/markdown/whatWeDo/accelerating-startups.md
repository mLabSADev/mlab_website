The Enterprise Development programme supports early stage digital-tech founders develop market ready offerings. Ultimately these stimulate job creation and revenue generation within the digital economy. Having contractually supported over 100 start-ups and hundreds more through our Ecosystem Development initiatives, mLab has multiple success stories from businesses, Transport, Education, Agriculture, e-Commerce, Health and Professional Services amongst other sectors who have secured growth funding, created jobs as well as positively enriched the lives of the people who use the digital solutions.
