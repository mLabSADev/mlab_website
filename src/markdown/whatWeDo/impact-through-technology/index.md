Our Technology Development arm enables the development of digital solutions that address social and economic challenges. Project examples include solutions for gender based violence (Ahmed Kathrada Foundation), food security (Agriculture Research Council) and youth unemployment (the South African Presidency through the DSI) amongst other projects. mLab start-ups and coding academy graduates are included in the projects whenever possible to expose them to real life development opportunities.
