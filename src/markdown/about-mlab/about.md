We have a strong focus on empowering youth, women and previously disadvantaged communities through digital skills training, enterprise support and technology development services.

mLab was established in 2011 by a consortium of organisations that include the World Bank (InfoDev), Department of Science and Innovation (DSI), The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in South Africa (CSIR) and The Innovation Hub (TIH) amongst other stakeholders to help open and expand the mobile applications economy in South Africa.
