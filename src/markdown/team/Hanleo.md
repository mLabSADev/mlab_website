Henleo Louw wants to be an adequate and professional project manager and currently in (Junior project coordinator). He likes to touch the lives of as many people as possible, empowering them to achieve personal and career happiness and success. I plan to achieve this career vision through developing confidence in clear communication and to be an effective communicator problem solver and, listening attentively to team members, stakeholders, and sponsors. I need to lead and manage more projects by identifying not only projects that will help me grow as a person but also grow the company I am working in. I also aim to better my Graphic Designing web developing skills through online short courses and staying up to date with current technologies.
