Tyson is passionate about programming, as a full stack developer, my personal version is to see myself changing the poultry farming industry with technology, creating more solutions and methodologies. I am a farmer, therefore that's my interest. I have been in the IT industry for more than 6 years, worked for a few companies and started my own business; therefore, I have seen a loophole in the poultry industry, which is why I am going after it.
