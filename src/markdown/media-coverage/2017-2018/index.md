This report is a follow-up assessment from the 2014 report [Do mLabs make a Difference](https://www.infodev.org/mobile/mLaboutcomes). The report shares key findings on the impact of infoDev’s mobile application labs (mLabs). mLabs were designed as pilot projects in 2011, to provide specialized incubation and acceleration services to digital entrepreneurs. In the years since the ecosystems they serve have grown substantially, and the mLabs’ business models have similarly evolved.
