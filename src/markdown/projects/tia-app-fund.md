title: TIA App Fund
description: TIA and mLab Southern Africa entered into a partnership that would
  empower local mobile application start-ups or innovators to pivot their
  technologies with the purpose of providing a potential pipeline for ICT
  innovations that may hold further relevance to the South African digital
  economy. The Project was divided into two seasons with the aim of allowing two
  groups of 7 start-ups to participate in the programme and leverage the
  learnings to improve each consecutive season. During the course of the
  programme over 200 potential application proposals where reviewed which
  resulted in 67 startups receiving support and training through either the
  season 1 bootcamps or season 2 pre-accelerator programme. These preparation
  programmes resulted in the development and support of 14 mobile apps or
  solutions and investment of R4,400,000.00 in development grants. The
  initiative resulted in an increase in users reached, IP registrations,
  revenues generated, full-time and part-time job creation, media appearances
  and business pivots amongst other positive outcomes. Notable ventures that
  have gone on to raise Series A funding or make significant traction in their
  respective sectors include; Droppa, Lightbulb Education, Jonga and Swift
  Livestock amongst others.
