  BOOST UP targets startups that use technology to solve a societal challenge
  and are

  looking for skills that could help them pitch their businesses and become investment-

  ready. BOOST UP is a three-part startup support programme in Botswana, Namibia,

  South Africa, Tanzania, and Zambia. The BOOST UP series comprises the Set Up

  training events, Stand Up pitching competitions, and Scale Up incubation programme

  and bootcamp. Start-ups compete in each country with the winning initiatives getting

  the opportunity to compete against the other winning ventures from the other Southern

  African countries. This Regional pitching event exposes winners to international

  opportunities and investors at events such as ASEB Summit which was hosted in

  Nairobi - Kenya, SA Innovation Summit hosted in Cape Town - South Africa and the

  the most founder-focused event on earth - Slush which is hosted in Helsinki - Finland.

  These expertise and networks could be leveraged to connect Lesotho ESOs and their startups to these regional and global innovation and entrepreneurship communities.
