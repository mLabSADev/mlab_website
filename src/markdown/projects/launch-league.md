  mLab was part of Launch League train-the-trainer initiative that helps hubs
  develop thriving local entrepreneurship ecosystems through the provision of
  quality tools, resources and training, and connecting organisations and
  individuals to share industry experience and insights. mLab is able to
  leverage these training materials and insights to assist ESO Leaders and
  Managers in Lesotho to provide structured and best practice methodologies of
  supporting their early stage entrepreneurs. With clost to 100 toolkits and
  resources; mLab is able to upskill and equip ESO managers on topics such as;
  Programme Design, Facilitating Finance for SMMEs, Tech Tools, Mentorship,
  Monitoring and Evaluation as well as Programme Management and Cyber Security.

  mLab is also part of a network of Hubs across Southern Africa as part of this initiative and hence provides strong opportunities to link the LEHSFF with international

  entrepreneurship programs and incubators, including through the Innovation Bridge Portal which is administered by the National Intellectual Property Management

  Organisation which is a Partner organisation to mLab and headquartered at the same Science Park as mLab.
