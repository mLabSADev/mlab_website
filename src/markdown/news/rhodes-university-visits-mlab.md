<p>As Guateng based innovators, students and entrepreneurs we are surrounded by many of the countries top infrastructure, facilities and programs to inspire and Â support our efforts to develop new products and partnerships.</p>
<p>Most of the local and global ICT companies are based on our doorstep and we sometimes forget the impact these elements have on achieving success as researchers, innovators and entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>So as part of a great program run by <a href="http://www.ru.ac.za">Rhodes University</a> to expose their Computer Science Honors students to the ICT industry in Gauteng, mLab recently hosted a number of students and some of our partners for an exciting day of project discussions.</p>
<p>The students, all working on very progressive technologies, had an opportunity to engage with <a href="http://www.theinnovationhub.com">The Innovation Hub</a>, <a href="http://www.theinnovationhub.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=63&amp;Itemid=211">Maxum Incubator</a>, <a href="http://www.theinnovationhub.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=47&amp;Itemid=190">Couch Lab</a>, mLab, <a href="http://www.developer.nokia.com">Nokia</a> &amp; the <a href="http://www.csir.co.za">CSIR</a> to understand more about their respective programs and opportunities.</p>
<p>We hope to see more of these collaborative investments in our youth and would like to thank all our partners who participated in making this day such a valuable experience for our guests.</p>
