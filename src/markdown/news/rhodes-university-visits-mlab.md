As Guateng based innovators, students and entrepreneurs we are surrounded by many of the countries top infrastructure, facilities and programs to inspire and Â support our efforts to develop new products and partnerships.

Most of the local and global ICT companies are based on our doorstep and we sometimes forget the impact these elements have on achieving success as researchers, innovators and entrepreneurs.

So as part of a great program run by [Rhodes University](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ru.ac.za) to expose their Computer Science Honors students to the ICT industry in Gauteng, mLab recently hosted a number of students and some of our partners for an exciting day of project discussions.

The students, all working on very progressive technologies, had an opportunity to engage with [The Innovation Hub](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theinnovationhub.com), [Maxum Incubator](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theinnovationhub.com&#x2F;index.php?option&#x3D;com_content&amp;view&#x3D;article&amp;id&#x3D;63&amp;Itemid&#x3D;211), [Couch Lab](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theinnovationhub.com&#x2F;index.php?option&#x3D;com_content&amp;view&#x3D;category&amp;layout&#x3D;blog&amp;id&#x3D;47&amp;Itemid&#x3D;190), mLab, [Nokia](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.developer.nokia.com) &amp; the [CSIR](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.csir.co.za) to understand more about their respective programs and opportunities.

We hope to see more of these collaborative investments in our youth and would like to thank all our partners who participated in making this day such a valuable experience for our guests.
