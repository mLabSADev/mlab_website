Al Jazeera is organizing an international hackathon this fall, and you’re invited to [apply](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;canvas.aljazeera.com&#x2F;apply&#x2F;).

We’re kicking off [Canvas](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;canvas.aljazeera.com&#x2F;), a platform for experimentation, with an inaugural hackathon in Doha, Qatar this November. If selected, you’ll collaborate with some of the most innovative minds in media and journalism to imagine the future of news and information.

We’re taking applications from designers, developers, media experts, and people with a passion for social innovation. We want to assemble a diverse and enthusiastic group, with a range of experience levels, ages, countries of origin, genders, and other aspects.

This is a collaborative event, though there will be awards for the most exciting and innovative solutions, with cash prizes and awards totaling $50,000 USD. Additionally, **Al Jazeera will cover accommodation, food and travel expenses for selected participants.**
