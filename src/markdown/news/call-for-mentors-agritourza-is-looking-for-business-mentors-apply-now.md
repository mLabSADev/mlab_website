##### About AgriTourZA

The Department of Science and Innovation’s (DSI) Regional Innovation Support Programme (RISP) aims to strengthen innovation ecosystems at sub-national levels through innovation challenges in partnership with regional partners. In 2021, mLab received RISP funding from the Department of Science and Innovation, through the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), to establish the first Agri-Tech and Travel-Tech innovation platform in Limpopo, also known as AgriTourZA.

The first and second phases of the AgritourZA Limpopo Innovation Platform have successfully provided business and technology development support to 40 early-stage start-ups to solve problems for the agriculture and tourism sectors using technology and innovation. In addition, 7  skilled developers who graduated from mLab’s CodeTribe Academy were recruited to design and develop 36 digital MVPs (minimal viable products) and 8 applications for the winning finalists. The first phase of AgriTourZA demonstrated much success in the demo day of the platform. 

The next phase (Phase 3), on which this proposal is based, is to continue with the momentum created in phases 1 and 2, that is to expand the reach of AgriTourZA.
