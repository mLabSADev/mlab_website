<p><em>After more than four months of work, the DEMO Team has now released the 40 demonstrators to launch at the first ever DEMO Africa Conference. The 40 finalists have gone through three rigorous vetting processes with the final vetting and adjudication done by a pan-African panel of judges including entrepreneurs, VCs and Academia.</em></p>
<p><em>“This has been a very enriching exercise seeing the kind of quality innovation coming out of Africa,” said Harry Hare, when announcing the names of the final 40. The process included several DEMO Africa innovation tours to encourage participation from technology startups from as many countries as possible.</em></p>
<p><em>A total of 500 applications were processed in lead to this event, these were then short listed to 150 ventures two weeks ago and now the final 40. “It’s been a great pleasure working with the different entrepreneurs. We congratulate the selected entrepreneurs and trust they will put their best foot forward in Nairobi. Now is the time to celebrate innovators from across the continent,” said Ben White, Founder, VC4Africa.</em></p>

We wish we could launch all of them at DEMO Africa, but that’s practically not possible,” said Hare. “We will however engage all of them and see how to assist them through the partnerships we have created to move their businesses to the next level,” he continued.</em></p>
