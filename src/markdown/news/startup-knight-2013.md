<p>Startup Knight was launched in 2012 for the first time, by software company Byte Orbit.</p>
<p>The premise of the competition is to promulgate, support and embrace tech startups in South Africa by offering a disruptive competition platform. Many competitions, in and around South Africa, offer similar competitions. Unfortunately none of them enter into a partnership with the winner in order to provide ongoing support. Furthermore the competitions are not hosted or sponsored by a software based company that can provide infrastructure and professional guidance.</p>
<p>Last year’s winners (Easy2Map) of Startup Knight excelled and received additional funding from Umbono Google. At Byte Orbit we are thrilled that our track record is a testament to the benefit that startups like Easy2Map receive.</p>
<p>This year Byte Orbit intends to up the stakes and offer an even greater opportunity for Tech Entrepreneurs and Concept Innovators in South Africa by introducing two divisions to the competition &#8211; Concept Phase and Startup Phase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Concept Phase: Moneypulation</b></p>
<p>R100 000 Cash Prize</p>
<p>The Concept Phase has been themed “Moneypulation” for 2013. This stream of the competition is designed to attract visionaries with the most innovative “concept phase” software products that will turn heads in the financial and tech industry. (Think BitCoin, Square, PayPal, Mint, Freshbooks etc.)</p>
<p><i>T &amp; C’s. </i>All IP of the winning concept is transferred to Byte Orbit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Startup Phase</b></p>
<p>R100 000 Development and R100 000 P.R. Prize</p>
<p>The Startup that has the most innovative software business that disrupts the South African tech industry.</p>
<p><i>T &amp; C’s.</i> The winning startup will enter into a partnership with Byte Orbit whereby Byte Orbit takes 15% equity.</p>
<p>This year Startup Knight is one of the biggest startup competitions if not the biggest in South Africa. Byte Orbit is the first software development company in South Africa to offer an opportunity of this magnitude in the form of an event to young and innovative tech entrepreneurs. Earlier this year Byte Orbit celebrated its 10th year in the software industry and CEO, Amit Ramdath, has expressed his determination to accelerate the local tech startup scene.</p>
<p>The startups and the concepts will be nourished as well as guided by an array of successful South African entrepreneurs. Some of these mentors include well known tech entrepreneurs:</p>
<p><em>Amit Ramdath CEO Byte Orbit, Martin Ras COO Byte Orbit, Charl Norman Co-Founder OnNet, Rob Gilmour MD RSA Web, Andre De Wet GM PriceCheck, Johan Nel CEO &amp; Founder Umuntu Media, Shaun Adler Founder &amp; Director Motillion, Daniel Guasco CEO Groupon SA, Farris Massoudi CTO Emerging Circle, Catherine Lückhoff Exco Member: Silicon Cape, Steven Ellis Co-Founder Easy2Map, Elmien Smit Co-Founder Runwaysale, Jesse Green CEO Perk, Karl Hammerschmidt Co-Founder Runwaysale, Kishan Kalan Co-Founder Runwaysale, Brad Page Media Director Neo@Ogilvy, Adii Pienaar Founder &amp; CEP WhooThemes, Anthony Stonefield MD Africa Gramercy Ventures.</em></p>
<p>Several partners came on board to make this event possible and Byte Orbit is very appreciative of Tech Report, SmileFM, Radisson Blu and BandwidthBlog.</p>
<p>The results of the winner will be announced at an invite-only cocktail event on the evening of 2 November at Radisson Blu, Granger Bay.</p>
