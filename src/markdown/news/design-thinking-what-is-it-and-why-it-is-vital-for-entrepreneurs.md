<p>As an entrepreneur, it is imperative for you to have a deep understanding of the customers that you are creating services or products for.  Your business model must be customer-centric. This means that how you design your product and how it gets delivered to the market should always consider the customer’s and other relevant stakeholder&#8217;s needs and expectations. Thus, as an entrepreneur, design thinking as a tool is vital for you to adopt.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is design thinking?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Design Thinking is a repetitive and creative way of thinking that intends to enhance understanding of the user or the customer. It includes redefining the problem you wish to solve and to identify alternative plans of action, and solutions that may not have been considered initially. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creativity and holistic thinking is a big part of this process; it requires brainstorming many ideas to address the problem, and it necessitates redefining the problem too. Most importantly, this approach considers the user’s perspective rather than your own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Design Thinking requires continuous examination or testing. According to Choene Makhasa, AgritourZA Limpopo’s Project Coordinator, “Testing, iterating and retesting in the design thinking process is important to ensure that the product or solution does not end up being a costly disaster”. She adds that often products are designed are not suitable for the market, thus costing entrepreneurs both time and money and potentially missing a market opportunity.  Makhasa suggests that the design thinking process should include evaluation of ideas, experimenting, prototyping, and testing to ensure that solutions have a good market fit. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Five steps in the Design Thinking process </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Makhasa recently presented an online workshop in Design Thinking; she tailored the workshop for aspiring entrepreneurs and  start-up business owners. She advises that the steps of Design Thinking do not necessarily have to be implemented linearly, they can occur in parallel or in a repetitive manner. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The five steps of the Design Thinking process include Empathise, Define, Ideate, Prototype, and Test, and are described below:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Empathise</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Establish empathy with your users. In this step you have to conduct research to understand the users for whom you are designing a solution. Once you understand the needs of your target audience, empathise with them, and come up with a solution that you would find valuable if you were in their shoes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Define</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; Combine all the research you have conducted to identify and observe the user’s problems. You may  have to redefine the problem to address assumptions that you might have made. This distinguishes between the real versus assumed problem. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Ideate</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; With an open mind, you should  brainstorm as many ideas about solutions to the identified problem. This must be a judgement-free space. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Prototype</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; The prototyping stage is experimental. This is where you build a tangible representation of the ideas generated, for example, by putting them down on paper or creating a presentation. The prototype will have to be tested.  </span></li>
<li><b>Test</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; This is where you test the functionality of the prototype. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These steps do not have to be implemented chronologically, the graphic below demonstrates the non-linear nature of the design thinking process:</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">A real example where Design Thinking was applied </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber is one of the top e-hailing service providers in the world. There must be something that makes them a leader in the industry, why are they so loved by people? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is because Uber put the needs of users at the center of its efforts to create a satisfying product. According to </span><a href="https://www.eleken.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eleken</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Uber put itself in the shoes of its customers and identified ‘waiting’ as a problem for users. They wanted to solve that problem by designing a product that would satisfy users in a way that they would get to their destinations faster and safer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Observe how Uber took a human-centric approach to create a product that would solve the problem of waiting for users: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one enjoys the lack of action in a situation where it is required. So Uber made sure that they interact with users by informing them about the ride, for example, informing the user that the driver will arrive at a certain time. There is a sense of empathy here.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber intentionally shows the user all operations of the service because they understand that customers like transparency. For example, they inform users of the waiting period and show them their estimated time of arrival. Obviously, when you are constantly being informed that your goal is closer to reach, the more you will want to get it. That is how Uber makes users feel.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This user-centred approach works well to solve the user’s problem of waiting, additionally people feel safe when they use Uber. Surely, the Design Thinking approach must have contributed to the company’s success!</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adopt a Design Thinking approach for your business</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understandably, we think of design as a craft where enticing logos, graphics, and advertisements are created. But the truth is, it goes beyond the creation of art, in essence, we are talking about ‘out-of-the-box&#8217; thinking. We are talking about innovation where you offer the world value and change with your solutions. If you innovate to bring a difference in people’s lives, the money will follow eventually. But money shouldn’t be your first agenda. Make meaning first. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being an entrepreneur requires that you think out of the box, and the design thinking approach enables entrepreneurs to be relevant, agile and responsive to users’ needs.  Fundamentally design thinking focuses on the ability to improve your products by researching and understanding how your customers respond or associate with your products. That will help you uncover new ways to better serve your customers.</span></p>
