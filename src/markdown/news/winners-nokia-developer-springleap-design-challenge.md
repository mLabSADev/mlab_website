<p>A couple of weeks back we reported on an <a href="http://mlab/nokia-calls-designers-pimp-devs/">innovative competition</a> Nokia was running in partnership with local design startup <a href="http://www.springleap.com">Springleap.com</a>.</p>
<p>Nokia put a bounty out for an awesome design they could use on their t-shirts as part of a way to thank and &#8220;pimp&#8221; their developer community.</p>
<p>Well the designs were submitted, the public voted and the top 3 designs were selected. Check out the winning designs <a href="http://www.springleap.com/posts/view/nokia-pimp-our-devs-winners-announced">here!</a></p>
<p>We love the inspirational quote from the winning designer:</p>
<div id="designStory">
<div>&#8220;Unfortunately, developers are often overlooked despite the fact that we use products they have created every day. With this in mind, I conceptualised the Nokia devs as ninjas, working and building awesome stuff behind the scenes.&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Here&#8217;s to all the Ninjas out there ðŸ™‚</div>
