We’re proud to announce that Karabo Malehu Molepo, a graduate from the CodeTribe 2021 cohort, has officially stepped into the tech industry as a Digital Developer Intern at Siyakha Consulting.

In her new role, Karabo is working with Laravel, building and maintaining web applications, creating RESTful APIs, and contributing to both internal tools and client-facing solutions. She’s also receiving structured mentorship and working on monthly assignments that match real business needs.

“This opportunity has me genuinely excited for the future,” says Karabo. “It’s a huge step toward becoming a full-stack developer, and I’m gaining practical experience in a professional tech environment. It’s motivating and empowering to know I’m part of real projects and supported by industry mentors.”

Karabo credits her time at CodeTribe as a key part of her journey. “The skills I gained through CodeTribe, particularly in React, JavaScript, mobile development, and backend integration using Firebase and AWS, have given me a strong foundation,” she said. She also added that the CodeTribe training has helped her adapt quickly to using Laravel and understand both the front-end and back-end development processes in a team environment.

The entire CodeTribe community is cheering her on as she begins this chapter.
