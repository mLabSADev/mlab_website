<strong>Cutting-edge mLab in Pretoria set to unleash mobile entrepreneurship across Southern Africa</strong></p>
<p><em>Pretoria, 15 September 2011</em> &#8211; A new regional lab for mobile technology entrepreneurs, application developers, and innovators (<em>mLab</em>) was inaugurated today by business and government leaders in South Africa, with the participation of around 150 stakeholders eager to use the cutting-edge facility.</p>
<p><em>mLab </em>Southern Africa’s activities are aimed at making the region a global hub for mobile innovations that will boost job-led growth and tackle economic and social needs. This strategically located facility will draw upon South Africa’s high bandwidth environment and talented pool of expertise with strong connections to the rest of Africa.</p>
<p>The first <em>mLab</em>, supporting the East Africa region, opened in Kenya in June 2011 and provides mentoring resources, on-site technical expertise and access to finance.  Drawing on the successful blueprint of the first facility, <em>mLab</em> Southern Africa’s key objective is to scale-up mobile entrepreneurship into sustainable businesses that create jobs and boost local economies. Three more <em>mLabs</em> will open by the end of the year in Armenia, Pakistan and Vietnam and be linked for cross-fertilisation of ideas and innovations.</p>
<p>“We believe that <em>mLab</em> can help us as a start-up mobile developing company to reach heights that we otherwise would not have attained,” says project manager Obakeng Matlhoko of Sowertech, a mobile web developer and one of the companies that will be using <em>mLab</em>’s facilities. “We are excited about the international linkages of the <em>mLab</em>,” Matlhoko adds.</p>
<p>The <em>mLab</em> Southern Africa fills a void.  Although the region offers an enormous business opportunity in the mobile sector given that mobile penetration is over 100% in South Africa, there are still challenges to creating a sustainable business in this sector.  Competition is stiff, and mobile developers are scarce and expensive. The <em>mLab</em> provides networking and training opportunities, support for the development of a viable business model, mentoring, subsidised office space, and technical and financial support. These services are aimed at helping the mobile entrepreneur navigate the vulnerable start-up phase, which is when most fledgling efforts flounder.</p>
<p>Thabo Mofolo of Bamboo Computing Services will be using the <em>mLab</em> for the development of BusBuddy, a mobile application that allows users to consult bus schedules for specific routes. “The assistance of the <em>mLab</em> to entrepreneurs in the development of their business model and also the experience the<em> mLab</em> team brings in successfully implementing reputable projects, is of great added value,” says Mofolo.</p>
<p>While the region’s <em>mLab</em> hub is in Pretoria, a number of satellite offices are planned throughout the region, including in Cape Town.  In the months leading up to the official launch,<em> mLab</em> Southern Africa has already run training events in Pretoria and in Cape Town, servicing over 80 <em>mLab</em> members.</p>
<p><em>mLab</em> Southern Africa is co-hosted by CSIR Meraka Institute, The Innovation Hub, InnovationLab and Ungana-Afrika. Financial support is provided by the South African Department of Science and Technology (DST) and <em>info</em>Dev, a World Bank Group global program focusing on supporting technology-driven small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).  <em>mLabs</em> are a result of the private – public partnership entitled <em>Creating</em> <em>Sustainable Businesses in the Knowledge Economy</em> between the government of Finland, Nokia, and <em>info</em>Dev / World Bank. The aim of the program is to encourage innovation and competitiveness among SMEs in the information and communication technologies and agribusiness sectors in particular.</p>
