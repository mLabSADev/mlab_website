The mLab Southern Africa (SA) has been tasked with managing a Gauteng Innovation Challenge (GIC) for mobile solutions on behalf of the Innovation Hub. Such challenges essentially invite members of the public to submit entries that either solve a particular problem, or simply demonstrate the most innovative apps in a particular sector. Examples of other past and present challenges include the following:

*   Nokia’s [Calling All Innovators](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.callingallinnovators.com)
*   World Bank’s [Apps for Development Challenge](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;appsfordevelopment.challengepost.com&#x2F;)
*   Design Indaba [Your Street](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.designindaba.com&#x2F;yourstreet)
*   Blackberry’s [App Master Challenge](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;blackberryappmaster.co.za&#x2F;)

A core part of any online challenge is the website itself. The mLab SA is **requesting proposals with quotes for the design, development and hosting of a challenge site**.
