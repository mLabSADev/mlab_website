<p>The mLab Southern Africa (SA) has been tasked with managing a Gauteng Innovation Challenge (GIC) for mobile solutions on behalf of the Innovation Hub. Such challenges essentially invite members of the public to submit entries that either solve a particular problem, or simply demonstrate the most innovative apps in a particular sector. Examples of other past and present challenges include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nokia&#8217;s <a href="http://www.callingallinnovators.com">Calling All Innovators</a></li>
<li>World Bank&#8217;s <a href="http://appsfordevelopment.challengepost.com/">Apps for Development Challenge</a></li>
<li>Design Indaba <a href="http://www.designindaba.com/yourstreet">Your Street</a></li>
<li>Blackberry&#8217;s <a href="http://blackberryappmaster.co.za/">App Master Challenge</a></li>
</ul>
<p>A core part of any online challenge is the website itself. The mLab SA is <strong>requesting proposals with quotes for the design, development and hosting of a challenge site</strong>.</p>
