**mLab Southern Africa joins the International DEMOLA Network with the first DEMOLA planned in Cape Town.**

mLab Southern Africa and the Demola Network announce a partnership to launch Demola in South Africa.

Cape Town, South Africa, May 24, 2016 – mLab Southern Africa today announced a new partnership with the international [DEMOLA Network](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.demola.net). The partnership will see the establishment of new Demola centres in South Africa, facilitated by mLab Southern Africa and hosted as part of the mLab’s youth and innovation ecosystem.

_“This is a very exciting new chapter for mLab and the local innovation ecosystem. South Africa has an abundance of talented youth studying at university, talent that should actively participate and contribute our country’s R&amp;D capacity. Broader participation by youth and industry is essential if we wish to reach the R&amp;D investment target of 1.5% of GDP. Demola offers us a proven model and an international network to connect multidisciplinary students and industry. It will also help create new wealth because the students own the intellectual property and the business partners have potential to license it after 4 months of development in the programme” Derrick Kotze, CEO mLab Southern Africa_

The first DEMOLA in South Africa will be hosted in Cape Town and will become a flagship hub for the partnership as it expands to more cities.

The DEMOLA will bring together local and international Industry, SMME’s and multidisciplinary students to develop solutions for real industry challenges. The first DEMOLA season will kick off in Cape Town in July 2016 and will have a dedicated mHealth &amp; Wellness stream supported by the CSIR.

The DEMOLA network stretches across 11 countries and 14 locations linking together over 50 Universities and 600 Company Partners.

_“Demola South Africa opens new avenues for cooperation of businesses and universities in the region and internationally. Around the world Demola has been proven to spur investments into innovative R&amp;D and helping businesses to turn their focus to the future problems with practical ways to explore them. At the same time creating a new generation of talented youth is becoming increasingly important for competitiveness of the ecosystems and we are excited to see African partners and universities working together to achieve it.” Ville Kairamo, Head of Demola Network_
