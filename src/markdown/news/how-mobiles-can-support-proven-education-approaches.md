On 19 August Steve Vosloo, Mobile Impact Evangelist at mLab Southern Africa (SA), gave a presentation on [How Mobiles Can Support Proven Education Approaches](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.slideshare.net&#x2F;mlabsa&#x2F;examples-of-mobile-interventions) (Slideshare) at the inaugural [m4Ed4Dev (Mobiles for Education for Development) symposium](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.regonline.com&#x2F;builder&#x2F;site&#x2F;default.aspx?EventID&#x3D;968312) in Washington DC. At the event, organised by USAID, Steve highlighted examples of how mobile interventions (existing and future) can support proven educational approaches, e.g. focusing on literacy and numeracy.

The symposium brought together academics, development professionals, mobile developers, educators, and representatives from the private sector to assess the current state of mLearning and discuss the future of the soon-to-be-formed mEducation Alliance.
