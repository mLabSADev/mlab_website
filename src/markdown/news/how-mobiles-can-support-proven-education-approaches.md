<p>On 19 August Steve Vosloo, Mobile Impact Evangelist at mLab Southern Africa (SA), gave a presentation on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/mlabsa/examples-of-mobile-interventions">How Mobiles Can Support Proven Education Approaches</a> (Slideshare) at the inaugural <a href="http://www.regonline.com/builder/site/default.aspx?EventID=968312">m4Ed4Dev (Mobiles for Education for Development) symposium</a> in Washington DC. At the event, organised by USAID, Steve highlighted examples of how mobile interventions (existing and future) can support proven educational approaches, e.g. focusing on literacy and numeracy.</p>
<p>The symposium brought together academics, development professionals, mobile developers, educators, and representatives from the private sector to assess the current state of mLearning and discuss the future of the soon-to-be-formed mEducation Alliance.</p>
