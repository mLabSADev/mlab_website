<p><strong style="color: #d62631;">M2M Solutions Challenge</strong><br style="color: #000000;" /><span style="color: #000000;">Take your connected devices solution to market.</span></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">MTN Business, in association with <strong>Intel</strong> and <strong>The Innovation Hub</strong>, are looking for the hottest development teams in South Africa – people with vision and innovation in their minds and in their code. If this sounds like you, we invite you to participate in the <em><strong>2015 MTN Business Mind2Machine Awards</strong></em>. This event takes the form of a M2M solutions development challenge &#8211; the first of its kind in South Africa. The winners will have the chance to partner with Africa’s telecommunication and technology giant MTN Business in monetising their idea and launching it in the business market.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">The Challenge has a dual purpose: to bring together a community of developers in the M2M space, and to foster the growth of M2M locally. Ultimately, MTN Business would like to partner with pioneering developers to bring exciting, original M2M solutions to the South African market.<strong> The winner of this competition will see his/her solution monetised in conjunction with MTN Business.</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong style="color: #d62631;">The briefing day</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>The briefing day – held at the MTN on April 17th</strong> – is compulsory for all entrants. No exceptions will be made. MTN Business will use this opportunity to present the business problems around which the whole development challenge centers, and participants will bid for their prefered business vertical. MTN Business will also be able to further explain the prize partnership, the winning criteria, and answer any questions developers may have. Additional sponsors Innovation Hub and Intel will also address the competitors and use this opportunity to showcase other exciting opportunities.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong style="color: #d62631;">Criteria:</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong>MTN is looking for big, bold and exciting solutions*.</strong> The concept is paramount, but the final submission from participants must be a working prototype software solution to demonstrate a majority of the final components’ functionality, and show scalability to the final concept. It must also be clear what the intended platform, market solution is for the proposed business problem. Entrants will be judged on the quality of the overall idea as well as the prototype (implementation) demonstrated.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;">As part of your final submission, participants will be expected to present a proposed budget and timeline for completion of their solution, including “man hours” and resources required. MTN will not be responsible for bringing the solution to a commercial ready state. The onus remains with the development team. MTN’s relationship only commences thereafter.</p>
<p style="color: #000000;"><strong style="color: #d62631;">What’s in it for you?</strong></p>
<p style="color: #000000;">Yes, awards can mean bragging rights and industry kudos, but those don’t pay the bills.
