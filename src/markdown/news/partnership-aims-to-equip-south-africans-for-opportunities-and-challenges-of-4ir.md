<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An exciting new partnership between mLab and the Media, Information, and Communication Technologies Sector Education and Training Authority (MICT SETA) is poised to introduce several Information and Communication Technology (ICT) related interventions that will equip South Africans to respond to the demands and opportunities of a technology immersed future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">mLab is a technology-focused company that collaborates with partners to create a vibrant and robust innovation ecosystem. The non-profit organisation accomplishes this by identifying and nurturing young tech talent, assisting aspiring tech entrepreneurs and their fledgling businesses, and developing technology that affects change and improves the lives of ordinary South Africans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">mLab’s headquarters are in Pretoria, Gauteng, with provincial offices in the Northern Cape and Limpopo. To make our skills academy as accessible as possible, we have academies in Tembisa, Tshwane, Soweto, Polokwane, and Kimberly. We also run programs in other Southern African markets and can provide program participants with access to international opportunities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Education Commission, more than half of the nearly 2 billion youth worldwide will not have the skills or qualifications necessary to participate in the future characterised by the convergence and complementarity of emerging technology domains, broadly referred to as the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), or Industry 4.0</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This dire shortage of skills translates to more than 50% of tomorrow’s human capital being potentially unprepared to enter the workforce. This is bound to worsen existing chasms between those who are prepared for 4IR and those who are not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The partnership between mLab and MICT SETA is set to address this pressing challenge in South Africa through many interventions including accredited skills training, ecosystem building, workforce development programs, and public policy. “The agreement between the two parties brings South Africa closer to the National Development Plan; Vision 2030,” says mLab CEO, Nicky Koorbanally, “it is set to boost the economy, reduce unemployment, increase investment, and combat inequality by upskilling and reskilling South Africans to keep up with the rapidly changing labour market.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The MOU will be signed on Monday, 30 March 2022 in Pretoria and extends to the 31st of March 2024. </span></p>
