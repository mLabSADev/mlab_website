What we play is life. Thats the official theme for this year’s [TEDxCapeTown](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.tedxcapetown.org) event happening on 21 July.

For anyone who is a [TED](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.ted.com) fan, and who has had the privilege of attending the TEDxCapeTown event before, you know that its probably one of the most exciting days of the year and with a lineup of amazing speaker to enlighten and inspire you this year its one not to be missed.

Now, I know, we are not all lucky enough to have secured a seat for the day or to be in Cape Town on the 21st  so the awesome people at TEDxCapeTown.org has partnered up with mLab and [The Innovation Hub](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theinnovationhub.com) to host a live broadcast (simulcast) for fans in Gauteng.
