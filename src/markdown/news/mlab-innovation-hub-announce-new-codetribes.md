Over the last 2 years the mLab and Innovation Hub teams have been working hard on building out a programme that empowers youth with market appropriate mobile development skills. This commitment by The Innovation Hub and the Gauteng Province now brings further opportunity for youth in some of the provinces’ most vibrant and youthful communities and opens the door for them to join the tribe and participate in the coding economy” </em>Rulani Nevhufumba, mLab Facilitator &amp; CodeTribe Coach, mLab Southern Africa.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The partnership will see the expansion of the existing CodeTribe Academy at The Innovation Hub in Tshwane as well as the launch of a new academy in Soweto based at The Innovation Hub’s eKasiLabs Centre located at the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Soweto+Empowerment+Zone/@-26.262048,27.950294,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x66a15810962c3401!8m2!3d-26.262048!4d27.950294">Soweto Empowerment Zone</a>.  Further academies are planned in other township communities within Gauteng in the next 24 months.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #808080;">mLab Southern Africa is a technology accelerator and non-profit company (NPC), established by the The Innovation Hub and its founding partners, to focus on skills development, product development and enterprise development within the technology innovation economy across the mobile, internet of things, data sciences and digital design verticals.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #808080;">The Innovation Hub Management Company SOC Ltd (“TIHMC”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Gauteng Growth and Development Agency (“GGDA”), was established by the Gauteng Provincial Government through its Department of Economic Development (DED) to establish and manage The Innovation Hub as a science and technology park to promote socio-economic development and competitiveness of the province through innovation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #808080;">The purpose of establishing the eKasi Labs programme is to take innovation to the people by establishing co-creation and innovation spaces in the townships where local communities are able to access the services and facilities that are offered at The Innovation Hub. Extending these services and facilities to the townships addresses problems of access and seeks to re-industrialise the community and unemployed youth so that employment is created in their area of residence through skills and enterprise development.</span></p>
