<p><strong>OBJECTIVE: DEVELOP NEW LEARNING SOLUTIONS TO EMPOWER CHILDREN AND COMMUNITIES AROUND THE WORLD. MAKING THE IMPOSSIBLE POSSIBLE</strong></p>
<p><strong>GRAND CHALLENGE</strong></p>
<p>An estimated 250 million children around the world cannot read, write, or do basic arithmetic.</p>
<p>Many of these children are in developing countries without regular access to schools or teachers.</p>
<p>The benefits of a quality education cannot be understated. UNESCO estimates a 12% drop in world poverty if all children in developing countries had basic reading skills. In addition, studies link education to improved self-esteem, personal empowerment, creativity and critical reflection, along with improved health, increased political participation and community development.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, traditional models of education are not scalable. We simply cannot build enough schools or train enough teachers to meet the need.</p>
<p>In fact, UNESCO estimates that the world will need 1.6 million more teachers globally by 2015. And that number is set to double by 2030.</p>
<p>We need a new approach. One that will remove the barriers to a quality learning experience where the seeds of innovation can be imparted to every child, regardless of location or economic status. Itâ€™s time to democratize learning.</p>
<p><strong>COMPETITION</strong></p>
<p>The $15M Global Learning XPRIZE is a competition that challenges teams from around the world to develop open source software solutions that will facilitate an autonomous learning environment for children living in remote areas of the world. The winning technology will result in children achieving a predetermined level of proficiency in reading, writing and arithmetic.</p>
<p>The winning technology created from the <a href="http://learning.xprize.org/about/overview">Global Learning XPRIZE</a> will be open sourced and available to the world, to be iterated, improved upon and employed where needed.</p>
<p><strong>PRIZE PURSE</strong></p>
<p>The $15 million dollar prize will be awarded as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Phase I:</strong> Five finalist teams &#8211; $1 million each</p>
<p><strong>Phase II:</strong> Winning team &#8211; $10 million TIMELINE Prize launch: September 2014 Registration: Sept â€“ March 2015 Phase I: Teams will have 18 months to develop their solutionsâ€“ five finalist teams will be selected Fall 2016 Phase II: The five finalist teamsâ€™ solutions will be deployed across 100 villages in a developing country, reaching 3,000 children (ages 7-12), over the course of an 18-month period</p>
