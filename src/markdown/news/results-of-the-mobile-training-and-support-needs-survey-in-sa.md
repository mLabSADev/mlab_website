The results of the _Mobile Training and Support Needs_ survey were presented last night at [Mobile Monday Joburg](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.momojoburg.com&#x2F;). mLab Southern Africa (SA), along with Mobile Monday Joburg, ran the short survey to understand the training and general support needs of mobile developers and entrepreneurs in South Africa. Critical to the success of the mLab SA’s work is to ensure that we support real needs from those in the mobile community.  77 people responded.

There is a clear need to provide support on how to monetise mobile apps and content. In response, the mLab SA has created an [Application Monetisation and Commercialisation](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mlab.co.za&#x2F;resources&#x2F;application-monetisation-and-commercialisation&#x2F;) resources section on its website, as well as lined up two events in August (Pretoria and Cape Town) on _Monetising Your Mobile App or Content_, presented with InMobi, the world’s largest independent mobile advertising network. [Book your place](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mlab.co.zasa.eventbrite.com&#x2F;) at the events now.
