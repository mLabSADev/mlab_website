<p><span style="color: #339966"><strong>Please note that the AppStar Challenge competition closing date has been extended to the 15<sup>th</sup>November 2013.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #339966">On Friday 25<sup>th</sup> October there was a heavy traffic on the site and several people were trying to upload BIG files at the same time and that affected a delay in uploading. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #339966">Additional development platforms have also been added and <b>BlackBerry, IOS</b>, and <b>Windows apps can now be entered.</b></span></p>
<p>appStar is the annual developer contest conducted by Vodafone across several countries in Africa &amp; Asia. appStar 2013 is the latest edition of appStar to bring out all those innovative and cool apps that you always dreamt of developing. Our intent is to provide a platform for all local developers in the region to be showcased on a larger stage.</p>
<p>You made appStar 2012 a great success. That has encouraged us beyond measure to kick start appStar 2013 with a fresh look &amp; richer features. For example, we have introduced an &#8216;Ideas Contest&#8217; for non-developers to submit their app ideas (not that we block developers from submitting ideas but you know, we hope developers would have already built it!!).</p>
<p>You are eligible to participate if you are a developer from one of these countries: Egypt, Kenya, India, South Africa, and Tanzania (Read <a id="ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder1_hpTC1" href="http://vodafoneappstar.com/whatisappstar.aspx#">T&amp;Cs</a> for detailed eligibility criteria)</p>
<p>As in 2012, the contest will be two-phased. You will first compete with developers in your country. The top two developers from each country will then compete at an international stage (where you get to present / demo your app to a larger audience). The final winners are announced during the international contest. The international contest location is being worked on (watch this space!).</p>
<p>The local contest has different categories.<a id="ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder1_hpTC2" href="http://vodafoneappstar.com/whatisappstar.aspx#">Look at your country page</a> for details.</p>
