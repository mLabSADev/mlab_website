If there was ever any doubt about the amount of talent and innovation bubbling up in South Africa it was put to rest during last week’s marathon pitch days in Johannesburg and Cape Town.

mLab organized two very full days for our guests from [DEMO Africa](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.demo-africa.com) as part of their roadshow to find some of the regions best tech products to possibly Launch at the [DEMO Africa event later](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mlab.co.za&#x2F;demo-africa-search-begins&#x2F;) this year.

(Not even the unexpected snow in Johannesburg could keep the participants away.)

The DEMO team now has the hard task of selecting 40 of the best tech startups and products from across Africa to launch at the event that will see tech buyers, investors and media gather in Kenya in late October.

We will post an update once we know who was selected from Southern Africa.
