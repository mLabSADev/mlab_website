Every year mLab and The Innovation Hub play host to a Hackathon dedicated to the amazing semifinalists from the year's **[GAP ICT Challenge](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theinnovationhub.com&#x2F;gap&#x2F;ict&#x2F;)** to help them prepare for their final pitches. The Hackathon pulls on the skills and talent within our community and creates a platform of open collaboration where teams form to support a semifinalist and spend the weekend improving and expanding on those entries.

On 10 &amp; 11 October teams will join us at mLab at The Innovation Hub to show their support for our GAP ICT semifinalists and help them cross the finish line! If you are keen to participate please complete the form below and we will get in touch to confirm your attendance and answer any question you may have.

**Who Should Participate:**

You must be a skilled Software, Web or Mobile Developer or a Graphic Designer.

**Prizes:**

3 Top Hackathon teams will be selected, 1 week after the hackathon during a dedicated pitching session for the volunteer hackers, to showcase their improvement and contributions to the semifinalist projects. The top 3 teams will each win R4,500. Prize winners do not include the GAP ICT semifinalist or their core teams and prize money goes only to hackathon volunteers from that weekend.

**IP:**

All Intelectual Property remains with the GAP ICT semifinalist who will pitch in November.

**If my selected semifinalist wins GAP, do I qualify for that prize?**

No, the hackathon is purely a voluntary, fun and collaborative weekend with the opportunity to win Hackathon prizes.

**Event Details:**

10 &amp; 11 October

From 3pm (10th) 8pm (11th)
