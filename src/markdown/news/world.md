<p><a href="http://mfactory.mobi">Mfactory</a> recently launched their first version of My World, a series of fun and educational games aimed at pre-schoolers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#8220;The game levels and episodes cover the basics of the players life. They start out in their bedroom which has a number of objects to interact with and lead to a meaningful learning experience.&#8221; says founder Blessing Mahlalela.</p>
<p>Lead designer at mFactory, Kim Mukenge, described the entire game as a human journey from waking up in morning to going to sleep at night, from Monday to Sunday, from January to December. &#8220;My World will take children from their bedroomâ€™s, to school and the zoo with great learning opportunities along the way, with their new best friend and guide &#8220;Miss Cloe&#8221;</p>
<p>My World was conceptualized in 2013, after realizing that there was a need to improve the way children are educated and also, to make education as entertaining as childrenâ€™s movies and tv shows.</p>
<p>Mfactory is in the process of further development of more levels, extensions and episodes for the My World series.</p>
<p>To play and participate in the journey you can download the app on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mobi.mfactory.myworld&amp;hl=en_GB">android store</a></p>
