This morning it turned out to be a little harder to drag my self out of bed and I suspect I was not the only one. I could easily blame the cold but the truth is its the price you pay for having an awesome developer weekend!

This weekend saw around 70 developers &amp; crew attended the finals of what has now become the legendary #LumiaHack Hackathons. 48 hours of coding to crown South Africa’s best Lumia Developers.

mLabSA, Nokia and Microsoft turned Hanger 50 at the Rand Airport in Johannesburg into Developer HQ with 6 meals a day and enough sodas and coffee to keep the coding juices flowing. Not even the unexpected rain and freezing temperatures could dampen our spirits. Luckily the nice people from Nokia quickly organized us over a hundred warm blankets\* and ramped up the availability of hot chocolate just to make sure we didn’t lose any fingers to the cold.

The Hackathon kicked of with a presentation and talk from Qualcomm about their proprietary API’s and awesome Developer Program and was followed by a talk from Microsoft’s Kath Roderick on the new Windows 8 platform. Minutes later the first developers were already coding away on their first ideas…

_Now, for anyone who has not attended a 48 Hour Hackathon before, be warned that sleep is in very short supply, cleanly shaven faces turn into lumberjack stubble and time seems to fade into limbo until the announcement of “judging in 1 hour” shatters it all. In the end the reward of “surviving” and being able to see your idea run as a fully functional app on your smart phone makes it well worth it._

…Sunday came with some added excitement when the clouds finally parted and a little heat returned just in time to polish the apps up for judging. The judges rated each app on its Idea, Execution &amp; Design and in the end the 4 best applications were announced.

**1st Place** and overall winner of the LumiaHack went to Thabo Ndlovu’s **Universe** app which turns you into the centre of the universe and turns your contacts, by proximity, into other planets within your personal solar system.

**2nd Place** went to Henk van Jaarsveld with **Monster Defence**, a super fun game pitting your puzzle skills against an army of attacking monsters and zombies. Unlike traditional point and shoot games this one requires your to first organize your “ammo” before taking the shot.

**3rd Place** was awarded to Clint Lee for his **Remote Downloader** app that makes use of Microsoft’s Azure and allows you to browse the web on your phone and selecting files to be downloaded to your remote storage rather than the phone.

Part of the Final LumiaHack also had the best of the winning students from the respective regional contests compete for the **Best Student Lumia Developer** and the prize went to Peter Stone who developed a fun Augmented Reality game called **Germaphobe**. This game spawns cartoon like germs in your “real” environment and you are tasked with scanning it through your phone camera, finding them and destroying them to accumulate your score.[![](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mlab.co.za&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2012&#x2F;06&#x2F;Screen-Shot-2012-06-25-at-5.08.12-PM.png &quot;Screen Shot 2012-06-25 at 5.08.12 PM&quot;)](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mlab.co.za&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2012&#x2F;06&#x2F;Screen-Shot-2012-06-25-at-5.08.12-PM.png)

\* Nokia and the developers decided to donate their warm blankets to the annual Blanket Drive after the event. The local Blanket Drives collect blankets for the less privileged to give them a little warmth during these cold winter months. a big “LIKE” to @NOKIARSA for doing this!
