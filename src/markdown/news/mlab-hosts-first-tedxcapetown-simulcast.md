There are few things that inspire as much as a good TED talk and on 21 July we had the opportunity to share in some great locally grown ideas.

mLab in partnership with The Innovation Hub and [TEDxCapeTown.org](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;tedxcapetown.org) hosted the first [simulcast to Gauteng](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mlab.co.za&#x2F;tedxcapetown-21-july-official-simulcast-at-mlab&#x2F;) for this Cape Town based event.

Derrick Kotze, CEO of mLab said “This event was important for the partners to firstly break down the geographical borders that often limit innovation and sharing of ideas and secondly allowed us to show the power of the infrastructure and technology that is available to us. The simulcast was run over the web, in HD and without any problems or delays”

Justin Beswick, curator of this TEDx chapter spoke about the importance of such a simulcast in this video [http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v&#x3D;hS6PQMXe968](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v&#x3D;hS6PQMXe968)

mLab looks forward to hosting and partnering with more such initiatives to share ideas and stimulate innovation.
