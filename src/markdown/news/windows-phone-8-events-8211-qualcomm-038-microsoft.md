Come join us to explore how Windows Phone can enhance your business productivity and efficiency, securely – anywhere, anytime.

Windows Phone 8 provides everything that employees need to communicate and collaborate right out of the box, easily deployed and managed in a Windows infrastructure with Exchange Server, SharePoint, or Office 365. Employees will quickly be up and running with the familiar feel of Outlook Mobile, and can access, edit and sync documents easily with Office Mobile. All data is kept safe because the entire device is encrypted, automatically protecting files when they are saved to the phone. In addition, Windows Phone 8 is protected from malware and delivers a trustworthy platform for line-of-business apps that boost productivity.
