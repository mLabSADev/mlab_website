DEMO Africa has today joined Seedstars World for the first ever Flagship event in Lizzy Sports Complex, East Legon, Accra Ghana in a bid to boost the entrepreneurial spirit among start-ups in Africa. The exclusive one-day event will see the best-in-class startups pitch their ideas in front of a regional jury panel which comprises DEMO Africa’s event Director, Mbugua Njihia among others. 30 finalists of the regional events will be invited to Switzerland to participate in a 4-day bootcamp and the grand finale where they will compete in front of an international jury and European investors. Here, one winner will win up to USD 500’000 in equity investment.

While welcoming the supportive move, Seedstars CEO Alisee De expressed optimism for the future of start-ups in Africa. “We have the best solutions for the needs in this continent. At Seedstar we are mandated to ensure that these solutions are taken to a larger scale.” She said. She urged the African investors to diversify investing opportunities from the traditional manufacturing, transport and real estate to newer ventures like technology which is quickly affirming itself as a profit generating industry in Africa.

On his part, the DEMO Africa executive producer Harry Hare said that he is encouraged by the milestones so far. He emphasized the need for combined efforts to achieve better results in encouraging investment in start-ups across Africa and globally.

For its first ever flagship event, SSW’s startup competition is supported by the Meltwater Entrepreneurial School of Technology; with Senior Faculty Member Richard Tanksley welcoming the efforts of the two giants and stating; “This type of ecosystem-building partnerships are exactly the type of support that we need in developing countries to help boost technology entrepreneurship.”
