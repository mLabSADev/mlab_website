<p><strong>Space Apps Hackathon taking place this weekend!</strong> We were skeptical about continuing with the original date due to the public holidays however it would not be the same experience if we chose to do it independently of the global community.</p>
<p><a href="http://mlab/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-GB&amp;q=http://mlab/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1493301056018000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFLevY0aiWDCIyZ3mkldQLYqD_woQ">mLab SA </a>is proud to present<strong> </strong><strong>The NASA International Space Apps Challenge 2017 </strong><strong>this weekend (29th &#8211; 30th April)</strong> at the Cape Town lab starting promptly at 9:00AM.</p>
<p>Since its inception in 2012, the International Space Apps Challenge has become the worldâ€™s largest global hackathon, engaging thousands of citizens across the globe to work together with NASA to build innovative solutions to complex challenges using open source data. Space Apps inspires local innovation communities to convene, ideate and create. Teams of technologists, scientists, thinkers, designers and entrepreneurs work together in a 48-hour sprint to develop solutions to some of the most pressing challenges on Earth and in space.</p>
<p><strong>Is the event limited to just software developers?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely not, Space Apps projects don&#8217;t have to be apps. We need people with all types of skills to participate! Teams need project managers, designers, artists, educators, writers &#8211; anyone who can help advance the cause. You can contribute! Participants in the event will collaborate to build software, open hardware, data visualization, and citizen science platform solutions that contribute to solving global challenges that focus on improving life on earth. In fact, most teams will benefit from having non-programmers working with them.<br />
<strong>Teams:</strong></p>
