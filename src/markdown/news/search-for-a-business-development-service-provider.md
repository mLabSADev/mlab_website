<h3>What is AgriTourZA Limpopo?</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, mLab was selected into the Regional Innovation Support Programme (RISP). This programme is an initiative  from the Department of Science and Innovationand managed by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). mLab was tasked with establishing the first Agri-Tech and Travel-Tech innovation platform in Limpopo.  The aim of the project is to stimulate and build the innovation ecosystem, particularly amongst the youth and rural communities, enabling them to connect, co-create and build agricultural, travel and tourism technological solutions to solve local societal challenges, thereby unlocking economic potential in the region. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The</span><a href="http://www.agritourzalimpopo.co.za/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> AgriTourZA Limpopo Innovation Project</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> includes a physical hub with hosted infrastructure made possible with support from Limpopo Connexion, outreach programmes to create awareness and excitement about the digital economy, and implementation of various interventions to accelerate skills, entrepreneurship and networking capability so as to promote the development and commercialisation of new digital or tech-enabled products and services in the region.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first cohort of the AgritourZA Limpopo Innovation Platform has successfully provided business and technology development support to 20 early stage start-ups to solve problems for the agriculture and tourism sectors using technology and innovation. In addition, 6  skilled developers who graduated from mLabâ€™s CodeTribe Academy were recruited to design and develop 16 digital MVPs (minimal viable products) and 4 applications for the winning finalists. </span></p>
<h3>Deadline</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please submit your proposal and costing to </span><a href="mailto:choene@mlab.co.za"><span style="font-weight: 400;">choene@mlab.co.za</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by 29 July 2022 before 14:00.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to budgetary constraints, if mentorship sessions are to be held in-person, the service provider will incur the costs. However, mLab offices at 15 Biccard Street in Polokwane are available for use, for free to conduct the sessions. </span></p>
