On the 1st of August 2012 MTN hosted the first MTN APP of the year awards. It was a glitzy and fun awards evening fit for South Africa’s new developer super stars.

The industry was present in full force with categories for best consumer and enterprise applications being sponsored by the [Core Group](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.core.co.za) (Apple), [Samsung](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.samsung.com&#x2F;africa_en&#x2F;#mobile-devices-home), [Blackberry](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.samsung.com&#x2F;africa_en&#x2F;#mobile-devices-home), [Nokia](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nokia.com&#x2F;za-en&#x2F;) and two categories for Most Innovative and Best Garage&#x2F;Indie App by [Business Connexion](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bcx.co.za) and mLab respectively.

Winners of each category walked away with a very large Angry Bird as trophy and the honour to call themselves the best developers in the country for the next 12 months.

mLab was very proud to sponsor the Best Garage&#x2F;Indie App developer award. This was made possible by all our generous partners. (World Bank, Gauteng Government, The Department of Science and Technology and Qualcomm)

Our category was won by [Glenn Stein](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;twitter.com&#x2F;GlennTheStein), for his app PhraZApp. PhraZapp is South Africa’s first multilingual phrase app to help us communicate  with each other in very simple terms. (South Africa has 11 official languages, so a very useful application)

We cant wait to see what Glenn developers next. Well done dude!
