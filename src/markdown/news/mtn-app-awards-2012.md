<p>On the 1st of August 2012 MTN hosted the first MTN APP of the year awards. It was a glitzy and fun awards evening fit for South Africa&#8217;s new developer super stars.</p>
<p>The industry was present in full force with categories for best consumer and enterprise applications being sponsored by the <a href="http://www.core.co.za">Core Group</a> (Apple), <a href="http://www.samsung.com/africa_en/#mobile-devices-home">Samsung</a>, <a href="http://www.samsung.com/africa_en/#mobile-devices-home">Blackberry</a>, <a href="http://www.nokia.com/za-en/">Nokia</a> and two categories for Most Innovative and Best Garage/Indie App by <a href="http://www.bcx.co.za">Business Connexion</a> and mLab respectively.</p>
<p>Winners of each category walked away with a very large Angry Bird as trophy and the honour to call themselves the best developers in the country for the next 12 months.</p>
<p>mLab was very proud to sponsor the Best Garage/Indie App developer award. This was made possible by all our generous partners. (World Bank, Gauteng Government, The Department of Science and Technology and Qualcomm)</p>
<p>Our category was won by <a href="https://twitter.com/GlennTheStein">Glenn Stein</a>, for his app PhraZApp. PhraZapp is South Africa&#8217;s first multilingual phrase app to help us communicate  with each other in very simple terms. (South Africa has 11 official languages, so a very useful application)</p>
<p>We cant wait to see what Glenn developers next. Well done dude!</p>
