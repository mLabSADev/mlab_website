<p>Following on from the <a href="http://mlab/preparing-african-mobile-entrepreneurs-for-their-big-pitch-insights-from-ryan-delk/">last post</a> where Steve Vosloo, Mobile Impact Evangelist at mLab Southern Africa (SA), interviewed Ryan Delk, here are a couple of questions that Ryan suggests every startup should be able answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is your company&#8217;s target market for the product?</li>
<li>Are you aware of other competing or substitute products?</li>
<li>What barriers to entry exist to keep other competitors from entering the market?</li>
<li>How does your company plan to monetise this product?</li>
<li>What are your immediate needs for growth?</li>
<li>How are you handling the technological infrastructure for scaling up?</li>
<li>Do you have any customers currently?</li>
<li>Why are you asking for this amount of money? Where exactly will it go and how will it be used?</li>
<li>What are your current and projected profit margins?</li>
<li>Are there any positions on your management team or board of directors available for a venture capital firm or investor to potentially fill if they were to invest?</li>
</ul>
