Following on from the [last post](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mlab.co.za&#x2F;preparing-african-mobile-entrepreneurs-for-their-big-pitch-insights-from-ryan-delk&#x2F;) where Steve Vosloo, Mobile Impact Evangelist at mLab Southern Africa (SA), interviewed Ryan Delk, here are a couple of questions that Ryan suggests every startup should be able answer:

*   What is your companyâ€™s target market for the product?
*   Are you aware of other competing or substitute products?
*   What barriers to entry exist to keep other competitors from entering the market?
*   How does your company plan to monetise this product?
*   What are your immediate needs for growth?
*   How are you handling the technological infrastructure for scaling up?
*   Do you have any customers currently?
*   Why are you asking for this amount of money? Where exactly will it go and how will it be used?
*   What are your current and projected profit margins?
*   Are there any positions on your management team or board of directors available for a venture capital firm or investor to potentially fill if they were to invest?
