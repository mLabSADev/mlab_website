The 1.5 hour workshop was sponsored by [InMobi](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.inmobi.com&#x2F;), the world’s largest independent mobile advertising network.

About 50 people gathered to hear [Terence Eden](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.twitter.com&#x2F;edent), Manager of Developer Community at InMobi, talk about monetisation through advertising on the InMobi network.

Following that Keegan Ziady, an intern with mLab SA, presented **[Mobile Monetisation: A Revenue Stream Framework](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.slideshare.net&#x2F;mlabsa&#x2F;mobile-monetisation)** (on Slideshare), an overview of the different types of monetisation approaches in mobile.

Lastly was the Start-Up Pitch Contest, where three developers&#x2F;entrepreneurs got to pitch their mobile idea, with the audience voting for the winner by clapping the loudest! The prize was $250 in InMobi ad network spend to promote the idea.

This is the first of many events in Cape Town.

The same event was held in Pretoria at the [Innovation Hub](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theinnovationhub.com&#x2F;) on 26 August, with about 30 attendees. Six people pitched their mobile idea amidst a lively session with lots of questions and comments.
