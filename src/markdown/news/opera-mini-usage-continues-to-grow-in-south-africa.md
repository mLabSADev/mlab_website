[Opera Mini](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opera.com&#x2F;mobile&#x2F;), the free downloadable mobile phone web browser that makes surfing the mobile web light and fast by reducing image files sizes, continues to enjoy growth in South Africa. Remember that in Africa users pay for MB of data so every byte counts. Fewer bytes means a cheaper browsing experience â€” hence the popularity of Opera Mini on the continent.
