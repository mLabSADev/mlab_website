<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Mobile Web Africa returns to Johannesburg and promises to drive progress and raise the bar again</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://mobilewebafrica.com/">Mobile Web Africa</a> is returning to South Africa in a few weeks’ time. The organisers, All Amber, have announced numerous new measures, key partnerships and organised a superb venue, all of which support the objective of setting a new standard of excellence for technology conferences on the continent. Mobile Web Africa will be held on 10 and 11 September at the spectacular Randlords in Johannesburg.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In October 2009 Mobile Web Africa first cemented its position in the then relatively undeveloped conference market in South Africa. Five years on, and All Amber founder Matthew Dawes is keenly aware of the need to deliver an exceptional conference experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It’s remarkable looking back five years to when Mobile Web Africa was first launched. The events industry in SA has developed massively since we put together that event. For me, it’s important to see that my objective back in 2009 to facilitate the growth of the mobile data, services and products industry across the continent has come to fruition. I hope that the 15 events All Amber has organised across Sub-Saharan Africa have contributed to that growth. Mobile Web Africa 2014 is all about showing the progress the region has made,” says Dawes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Bringing Tomi Ahonen back to Jo’burg is a massive plus for the conference. He’s a global mobile industry rockstar and will be delivering material looking at the next stage of growth. The range and breadth of <a href="http://mobilewebafrica.com/2014/speakers/">the contributors</a>is outstanding. We have confirmed individuals such as Gustav Praekelt, Emma Kaye and Chika Nwobi (who is coming in from Lagos specifically for the event); Robert Lamptey from Saya in Ghana is an incredible presenter; Nanjira Sambuli from the iHub in Nairobi is going to discuss ICT4D and innovation; and then you’ve got market leading organisations including Standard Bank, Junk Mail, KPMG, Mahindra Comviva, Yahoo! and Deloitte.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For Thursday lunch we’ve brought together Intel, AppCircus and Mobile Monday South Africa for a <a href="http://mobilewebafrica.com/2014/app-developer-competition/">mobile app competition</a>. Africa’s leading app developer will win the chance to represent the continent on the world stage at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Intel is also generously providing <a href="http://mobilewebafrica.com/2014/startups-devs/">complimentary tickets</a> for 10 leading start-ups and developers. Another feature that we introduced at our 2014 events in Kenya and Nigeria is the <a href="http://mobilewebafrica.com/2014/day-1/#0900">“Leaders of Mobile” keynote session</a>. This will be brought to the Johannesburg event, and will kick-start the conference and tackle the core issues that need discussion to enable further progress.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, Mobile Web Africa will be hosting the inaugural Standard Bank MMA SMARTIES™ Awards on the evening of 10 September. This will be an evening highlighting the work that is leading the industry in taking mobile marketing to the next level, and represents an ideal collaboration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Year-on-year the event has delivered crucial business development opportunities and Randlords is the perfect environment for Mobile Web Africa 2014. Attendees will receive table service during sessions so that the market leading organisations and the current and future industry leaders are able to focus entirely on the matter at hand: developing the industry even further.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Mobile Web Africa 2014 agenda is available to view online at the event website: <a href="http://www.mobilewebafrica.com">www.mobilewebafrica.com</a>. As is normally the case with All Amber conferences, it has been split into eight distinct sessions over two days. Sessions include: The leaders of mobile; thought leader interview and address; the landscape for digital entrepreneurs across Sub-Saharan Africa; driving thought leadership in mobile marketing; the debate around the future of mobile money; smart cities and smart living; mobile content, users &amp; consumption; and showcase presentations.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>About Mobile Web Africa </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Back in 2009, there simply weren’t many conferences in Sub-Saharan Africa, especially ones that focused purely on mobile data, products and services. When you combine the prevalence of the mobile handset with the extraordinary potential of the web and apps then what you’ve got is a game changer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since 2009 Mobile Web Africa, and its sister events Mobile West Africa and Mobile East Africa, have become the leading mobile technology, business-to- business, conferences on the continent. The conference brings together the best brains in the African mobile ecosystem.</p>
