**Take part in the local South African SLUSH GIA competition to join the Slush 2016 Global Impact Accelerator program!**

_We are excited to announce that the local Global Impact Accelerator (GIA) competition will again take place in South Africa. This will be the 3rd year South African Startups stand a chance to participate in GIA and experience SLUSH._

[**Slush Global Impact Accelerator**](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.slush.org&#x2F;gia&#x2F;) is a program created in collaboration with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland and multiple global partners. The purpose of GIA is to create a leading global program to support startups that are looking to solve some of the most pressing global challenges and to contribute to the discussion on impact investing.

Slush Global Impact Accelerator 2016 brings impactful entrepreneurs from emerging markets to Helsinki to accelerate their business, attract additional financing and make an even greater impact on their societies and beyond. The program includes online pre-event coaching and the Helsinki boot camp program from November 22–December 2, 2016 culminating in Slush.

Last year 15 hubs from around the world took part in this program and this year it is expanding to 20. A group of 40 entrepreneurs will join the program after all the final selections procedures are completed. Also, all the hubs will be joining the program in Finland.

The design of the accelerator program builds on local innovation ecosystems, with the aim of helping to develop local capacity and support the creation of local impact ecosystems. This year, the whole of the Nordics will join us to build life-lasting connections.

[Slush is Europe’s leading startup and technology event](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;r_CpNaCvaoc) (Video), which connects startups and tech talent with top-tier international investors, executives, and media. In 2015, Slush brought together 15,000 attendees from one hundred nations for the two day event held in Helsinki, Finland.

**What are we looking for?**
