<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the greatest things about being young is that you have the time and energy to create opportunities for yourself and other people. For many reasons, young people start their own businesses, some identify a gap in the market and some are forced to start businesses because they cannot find employment regardless of having qualifications. And that is why it is important to unlock your potential. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having started his first business while studying for a Law degree at Nelson Mandela University, Amandla Didiza is now the Founder of The Black Brand. To get to where he is today, he has and still continues to work hard to shape himself into a holistic entrepreneur.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Didiza started a clothing line in university, as much as the business was unsteady he says it provided him with the foundational tools to move on to a different business, which was a printing and branding business. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That one too, was performing well but Didiza had to balance being an entrepreneur and a student at the same time, eventually, he decided to let go of the business to focus on school. He then started a new business after graduating with his BA Law degree (LLB).</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Identifying a gap in the market</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Passionately, Didiza said, “I saw a gap”. Some people’s mindset toward entrepreneurship is to make money and be successful. Didiza says, as a result, most young entrepreneurs do not understand the challenges that come with entrepreneurship because business leaders and speakers tend to glamourise the industry, “No one talks about the interlocked threads that make a successful entrepreneur”, he added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Didiza insists that entrepreneurship is ‘practical’ so aspiring entrepreneurs must be made aware of those practicalities the challenges that are faced by small businesses in South Africa. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Education for aspiring and emerging entrepreneurs must be delivered to them through transparent engagement. That means what they are being taught must truly speak to their needs to become successful entrepreneurs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is for this reason that Didiza started an engagement strategy company, The Black Brand</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">which is a multifaceted company that focuses on digital marketing, creating engagement strategies for clients, as well as strategies for entrepreneurship development and upscaling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the realisation that ‘impact’ in engagement spaces like business talks was missing, The Black Brand ensures that such spaces of engagement carry and deliver messages effectively.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There needs to be tangible and measurable results of how people are impacted by engagement events”, he added.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t rush into big business: take the time to explore, learn and grow.</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Black Brand is 6 years old, just like any other entrepreneur Didiza has made mistakes along the way. “I think when you’re a young entrepreneur, you tend to seek validation and end up losing focus”, said Didiza. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He advises that young entrepreneurs must not rush into big business. When Didiza started The Black Brand he also fell into the trap of wanting to quickly accelerate his business. “We wanted to get an office space, a company car, hire more people and build brand awareness”, he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of those things are great but there is no need to rush the process, in entrepreneurship you must be patient. Take the time to let it find you through exploration, perhaps start looking for industry leaders and find out how they are winning in the game. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take the risk to start your own business</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some young people want to start their own businesses but they are not. Because of the fear of failure or lack of resources and many other reasons.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Businesses fail daily but they are constantly trying to thrive and that’s the nature of entrepreneurship”, said Didiza.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He asserts that young and aspiring entrepreneurs must talk themselves out of the fear of starting a business, they must ask for lessons from other budding entrepreneurs in their communities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having the right kind of mind to become a resilient entrepreneur is crucial, “It is not just about making money, focus on the impact you want to create with the business”, he added. </span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tap into the right pattern of thinking </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resources like capital and education are some of the challenges that aspiring entrepreneurs are facing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Didiza says aspiring entrepreneurs must look around them and seek entrepreneurial lessons. “The ladies and gentlemen you see selling goods in the streets are entrepreneurs, talk to them to teach you about business, they may not have balance sheets or even a business account but you can learn from them”, he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You don&#8217;t have to make the same mistakes as other entrepreneurs and that’s why it is important to try and speak to the right people. That will train your mind to start thinking entrepreneurially.</span></p>
