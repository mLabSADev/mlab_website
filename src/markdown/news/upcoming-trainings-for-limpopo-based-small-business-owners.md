Digital technology and media have disrupted the business industry, and the disruption became more intense during and after the Covid-19 pandemic. This era of digitisation has propelled businesses to find innovative and creative ways of engaging with customers. 



It is for this reason that small businesses need to adapt to new customer behaviour, by leveraging the power of digitisation. 



We have a great opportunity for small business owners based in Limpopo to take a short course on Introduction to Digital Entrepreneurship. This training is initiated by the National Electronic Media Institute of South Africa (NEMISA) and implemented by Limpopo CoLab and the University of Limpopo. 



mLab and AgritourZA are ecosystem partners of this initiative.

## Rural and Township SMMEs must be assisted to benefit from this digital transformation



Digitising a business has great benefits but most importantly it prepares the business for an agile and tech-driven future. 



Some of the benefits of transforming a traditional business into a digital enterprise include better customer service and experience, higher productivity, improved operational efficiency, and more. James Lentsoane, the Training Coordinator at Limpopo CoLab said rural and township SMMEs are missing out on such benefits because they do not have the skills to digitise their businesses, hence these training workshops. 



"We are now in the Fourth Industrial Revolution and because of that there are a lot of changes in the industry that pose challenges to rural and township SMMEs, we are here to assist them”, said Lentsoane.
