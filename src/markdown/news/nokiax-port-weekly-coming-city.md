<p>The Nokia X family provides users access to the world of Android applications, with exclusive Nokia experiences and the most popular Microsoft services. The Fastlane UI makes the experience faster and smoother, while the Nokia X smartphones are wrapped in standout Nokia design.</p>
<p>Nokia &amp; mLab will be hosting some fun Nokia X and porting events around South Africa over the months of May and June with the aim of introducing the South African Android talent pool to the exciting new Nokia X and its developer opportunities.</p>
<p>If you are an Android Developer with a working App and resident in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Cape Town, Durban and Port Elizabeth and interested in meeting the team from Nokia, learning more about Nokia X and seeing just how easy it is to port your existing apps then please register below and we will invite you to our Nokia Xport Weekly in your city.</p>

<p>There are a lot of good reasons to publish your existing Android apps for Nokia, here are our top 5:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>1. Nokia X opens new markets to your existing apps.</b></p>
<p>Nokiaâ€™s sales leadership and brand strength in the fastest-growing smartphone and mobile app markets provide the launch pad for your appsâ€™ success. With Nokia X, you can reach an untapped pool of savvy â€” and app-hungry â€” new smartphone users around the world.</p>

<p><b>2. Nokia Xâ€™s monetization tools create additional revenue streams for your apps</b></p>
<p>Monetization tools like Nokia In-App Payment, combined with Nokiaâ€™s extensive operator billing network, provide your existing apps with new monetization mechanisms in emerging markets. Consumers in many high-growth markets do not have international credit cards, making traditional revenue collection a challenge.</p>

<p><b>3. Android app compatibility</b></p>
<p>Nokia has tested over 100,000 Android apps and approximately 75% are directly compatible and ready to be published to Nokia Store. If your app uses Google services for maps, push notifications or in-app payments, you will need to replace these APIs with Nokia-specific APIs, which have been built to work almost identically to those they replace. Nokia services have been designed to minimize porting effort for apps using corresponding Google services, and to allow developers develop and distribute a single APK targeting both ecosystems.</p>

<p><b>4. Develop apps for Nokia X using your existing Android SDK, toolkit and skillset</b></p>
<p>If you already develop Android apps, you can continue to use your existing tool chain. If your app is one of the 25% that requires change, Nokia provides a plugin package for the Android SDK, including the services APIs and the Nokia X emulator. Youâ€™ve already got the other tools and skills you need.</p>

<p><b>5. Nokia Developer programs provide the marketing promotion you need</b></p>
<p>Through programs like DVLUP and local outreach, Nokia offers you opportunities to promote your apps to new users and potential customers, while our online training, events, and support tools make sure youâ€™re putting your best app forward.</p>
