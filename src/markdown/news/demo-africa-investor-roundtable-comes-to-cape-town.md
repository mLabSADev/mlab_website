<p>After two very successful DEMO Africa Startup Pitch days hosted in South Africa the DEMO Africa team has decided to return to host an Investor Roundtable event in Cape Town on 4 October 2012.</p>
<p>DEMO Africa, in partnership with USAID has organized 2 Investor Roundtable events in Nairobi and Lagos already and is now heading to our shores.</p>
<p>DEMO Africa&#8217;s organizers said that &#8220;These cities have been identified as “hotspots” for technology innovation and have consistently yielded high value investment opportunities in technology over the past several years. The main objective of the DEMO Africa Investor Roundtable is to bring together the investment community in these cities and engage in a discourse about investments that target technology companies.&#8221;</p>
