<p style="color: #000000; text-align: justify;">NxtGen Coders is a community project that aims and hopes to inspire scholars to choose an I.T as a career. We do this by introducing them to different aspects of IT and teaching them how to code. After a successful conference we are proud to announce we will be having a coding camp week for 40 scholars living in Cape Town.</p>
<p style="color: #000000; text-align: justify;">The camp will be held at Trafalgar High School from the 1- 5th of December, from 9:30 to 15:30. The scholars who will be participating attended the NxtGen Coders Conference held early October. This programme is for scholars between Grade 9 -11 who love programming and have some basic programming skills. The scholars chosen to attend were winners and runners up at the NxtGen Conference.The scholars have some Java knowledge and WordPress understanding.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This programme is for scholars between Grade 9 -11 who love programming and have some basic programming skills. The scholars chosen to attend were winners and runners up at the NxtGen Conference.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The scholars will leave the camp being able to code and inspired to solve community issues using technology. We require community support to ensure the camp is a success, this is a call for volunteers specifically to help teach scholars about  Game Development using Game Maker or Unity, Mobile Development using Fluid UI and other similar apps,Robotics using NodeJS and other similar apps . We will need at least one volunteer per day on each topic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you would like to volunteer or have enquiries please feel free to contact Mapaseka via email at <a href="mailto:Mapaseka@phpsouthafrica.com" target="_blank">Mapaseka@phpsouthafrica.com</a></p>
