As part of our buildup to the official launch of mLab Southern Africa in Cape Town we are hosting our first workshop on **6, 7 and 8 March** at mLab, The Barn, Woodstock Exchange.

[The Ideas Workshop](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;koistrategy.com&#x2F;the-idea-workshop) is an intensive three-day workshop to show you how to discover, develop and deliver new ideas for a new venture or to open up new markets and possibilities for your company. It is run by renowned serial entrepreneur Neil Hinrichsen and author of [KoiTips](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;koitips.com), who has been pioneering new ventures his whole life from providing one of South Africa's first online networks, to working with cutting-edge software, to representing the pathbreaking Internet company Netscape, to cofounding a mobile payments company acquired by Visa for $110m.  He now mentors a wide range of entrepreneurs across South Africa.

There are only **20 spots** open and participants who complete the workshop with viable mobile concepts  will be considered for the next mLab intake starting April 2014. Participation is free!

To book your spot please RSVP with [Rulani@mlab.co.za](mailto:rulani@mlab.co.za) before 27 February 2014.
