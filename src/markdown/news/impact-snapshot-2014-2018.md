[mLab Impact Report\_WEB\_102019](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mlab.co.za&#x2F;wp-content&#x2F;uploads&#x2F;2019&#x2F;11&#x2F;mLab-Impact-Report_WEB_102019.pdf)

Since 2012, mLab has become a leader in opening up opportunities for youth and innovators in the digital sector. What started as a platform for supporting the development of impactful mobile applications from idea to launch has evolved into a multifaceted organisation focused on building Africa’s most vibrant digital innovation ecosystem. We continue building this vision for 2019 and beyond through establishing new innovation communities, teaching code, facilitating lean innovation and hosting our start-up labs. At the heart of mLab’s work remains the belief that when our youth are empowered with the right skills to innovate and create solutions, they unlock the opportunities for optimising existing or establishing new businesses that will drive our economies forward. This is why we remain committed to support these young innovators, founders, next generation coders and digital creatives. In only six years we’ve made a tremendous impact in South Africa.

We’ve trained over 300 junior developers, mostly from South Africa’s townships, in mobile application development and Agile practice and helped to link them to employment and income opportunities. We’ve

supported over 65 early-stage digital start-ups that have gone on to positively impact thousands of users through their technologies, create nearly 300 new jobs, adding R30 million in early stage revenue to the digital economy. We’ve partnered with and supported the development of digital solutions with significant social impact, from cancer awareness to citizen water quality monitoring to agricultural empowerment apps. Our impact is primed to expand over the coming years as we offer our services to more graduates and enterprises and share mLab’s expertise in South Africa and beyond.

I am exceptionally proud of our team who are all young and dynamic, ready to shift and pivot as the digital ecosystem around us continues to change. Our partners are equally dedicated in supporting our growth and our continuously evolving business model.

We are proud of our impact over the past six years and look forward to what 2019 and beyond hold for mLab.
