##### About mLab

mLab is a digital and mobile solutions laboratory that provides technology-based support to unemployed
youth in the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector. mLab’s core mandate is to
accelerate the active and productive participation of ICT graduates and early-stage entrepreneurs in the
digital economy either through the securing of employment and/or self-employment opportunities, or
maximising the potential of entrepreneurship to create jobs and solutions to address societal challenges.
mLab works with various partners and stakeholders across the African continent to build a vibrant digital
ecosystem and ensure that our youth can maximise the opportunities of the digital economy.

For South Africa to maximise the socio-economic opportunities presented by the Fourth Industrial
Revolution (4IR) and advanced digital production technologies, it is imperative to enhance access to
these technologies, develop skills to utilize and build digital solutions to solve local socio-economic
challenges, and create an enabling environment that is conducive to innovation and entrepreneurship.

mLab offers a range of interventions to drive Ecosystem, Skills, Enterprise and Technology acceleration.
mLab’s headquarters are located in Gauteng, Pretoria, with provincial offices in the Northern Cape,
Limpopo and Kwa-Zulu Natal. mLab is registered as a not-for-profit company with PBO (public benefit
organisation) status and is Level 1 BBBEE certified. Its founding partners include the Department of
Science and Innovation, The Innovation Hub, CSIR, and the World Bank.

**Ecosystem Accelerator** – building strong ecosystems facilitates the awareness, adoption and use of
technology, whilst creating an environment in which digital skills and entrepreneurs could flourish. mLab
works with various ecosystem partners to build a vibrant digital tech ecosystem.

**Skills Accelerator** - our Coding Academies have supported over 500 software programmers with
approximately 60 - 80% gaining employment in the ICT sector post the programme. We have also
hosted a range of ICT and 4IR short training sessions for over 5,000 youth through over 200 events.

**StartUp Accelerator** – mLab runs a range of Enterprise Development initiatives which have supported
more than 100 start-ups who have gone on to impact thousands with their solutions, creating jobs and
raising funds in excess of R300 million.

**Technology Accelerator** - our Innovation Lab team has designed and launched solutions for gender-
based violence (Ahmed Kathrada Foundation), food security (Agriculture Research Council) and youth unemployment (mPowa for the South African Presidency) amongst other projects.

mLab works with youth in townships and/or remote areas to build advanced digital skills to improve their
prospects for employment or self-employment and to promote digital entrepreneurship. This needs
analysis is being commissioned to help mLab to better understand the environment and context in the
district, so as to customise its programmes to better serve its surrounding communities.

##### Scope of work

Qualifying service providers are invited to submit proposals to conduct a market needs analysis in the  district to support mLab’s operations in Imbali. The needs analysis should be a practical endeavour  delivering a real-world context rather than a theoretical exercise.  

**The aim of the market needs analysis is to:** 



1. Better understand the surrounding communities which we will serve and should focus on, inter alia:

a. Skills and levels of digital literacy in the community

b. Unemployment rates

c. Youth and their culture

d. SWOT analysis with regards to economic and social development

2. Understand the culture of innovation and entrepreneurship in the region.
3. Understand how the communities engage with various stakeholders particularly in the Imbali Precinct.
4. Determine the demand and absorptive capacity for digital skills amongst the key industry stakeholders.
5. Understand other needs that the industry may require.
6. Determine if there is an interest to partner with mLab to create opportunities for unemployed youth in the digital economy.
7. Identify who and where the key stakeholders actively involved in driving innovation and entrepreneurship are, what their focus is and whether they categorise as being able to collaborate, complement or compete with mLab.
8. Georeferencing and mapping where key stakeholders, suppliers and enterprise development programmes are located.
9. Summarise the findings into a report with recommendations for interventions that could address the key challenges through skills and enterprise development.
