Pretoria: On 1 September The Innovation Hub and mLab Southern Africa kicked off the first class of their new CodeTribe Academy.

CodeTribe is a collaboration between the Innovation Hub and mLab Southern Africa to increase the skills of talented young ICT enthusiasts by providing them a learning environment where they build real world products as part of a 1 year programme.

“The aim is to foster a culture of making within our country. We need to be Makers and we need to equip our youth with skills and encourage them to be curious, to investigate and to make rather than consume” said Aubrey Malabie, CodeTribe's Manager and one of the founders of the organization.

CodeTribe will have a yearly intake of students who show a passion for the industry and who are eager to become expert software developers. The Tribe includes 9 full time bursary students and The Innovation Hub &amp; mLab Southern Africa will be opening up applications for a further 10 bursaries on 9 September.

Mclean Sibanda, CEO of The Innovation Hub noted that “Given the future of technology and the Internet of Things, it is important that we invest in our youth to start to develop software code that can run not only on mobile devices and computers but also on devices in general.  CodeTribe is an important intervention in this area, directed at developing entrepreneurial code developers as well as meeting industry’s needs for software”

Sibanda was joined by mLab CEO, Derrick Kotze saying “This is a very exciting project that will allow us to grow local skills and improve the quality of mobility &amp; cloud software development. While mLab has offered short trainings and support in the past, the CodeTribe will allow us to focus on training and creating a strong pipeline of innovators and developers that will help drive South Africa's competitiveness in the Knowledge economy.”

The brand really reflects the vision of the academy with the programme creating a true community of developers that learn, code and even teach each other. “This is a Tribe of Coders, not just a class of individuals.” said Kotze.

Earlier this year The Innovation Hub made available one of the old farm houses on their campus in Pretoria and renovated it for the purpose of housing the new academy and while it is dedicated to providing daily training for the bursary students, the classes will be open for anyone keen to attend and learn. Keep an eye out for the topics being covered on Twitter handles: @mlabsa and @codetribesa.

The primary focus will be on Android, Cloud, Solutions Architecture &amp; broader Mobility.
