<p>mLab will be hosting an Internationalization workshop and GeekExchange on 17 January at The Innovation Hub in Pretoria. We kick off at 10:30am and will be running a number of interactive exchanges and a Pitch-ionary (pitching game) until 2pm.</p>
<p>As apps mature in your local market it becomes important to build a clear and executable strategy to venture into new markets. Join us as we cover some of the important considerations, look at some case studies, hear from some start-ups who have made the first steps to internationalize and come play our pitching game.</p>
<p>We have limited space left for this first workshop so please apply to participate by emailing <a href="mailto:rulani@mlab.co.za">Rulani@mlab.co.za </a> by 13 January.</p>
