The 1.5 hour workshop was sponsored by <a href="http://www.inmobi.com/">InMobi</a>, the world’s largest independent mobile advertising network.</p>
<p>About 50 people gathered to hear <a href="http://www.twitter.com/edent">Terence Eden</a>, Manager of Developer Community at InMobi, talk about monetisation through advertising on the InMobi network.</p>
<p>Following that Keegan Ziady, an intern with mLab SA, presented <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/mlabsa/mobile-monetisation">Mobile Monetisation: A Revenue Stream Framework</a></strong> (on Slideshare), an overview of the different types of monetisation approaches in mobile.</p>

<p>This is the first of many events in Cape Town.</p>
<p>The same event was held in Pretoria at the <a href="http://www.theinnovationhub.com/">Innovation Hub</a> on 26 August, with about 30 attendees. Six people pitched their mobile idea amidst a lively session with lots of questions and comments.</p>
