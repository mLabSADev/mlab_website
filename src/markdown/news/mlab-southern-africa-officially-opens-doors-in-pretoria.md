**Cutting-edge mLab in Pretoria set to unleash mobile entrepreneurship across Southern Africa**

_Pretoria, 15 September 2011_ – A new regional lab for mobile technology entrepreneurs, application developers, and innovators (_mLab_) was inaugurated today by business and government leaders in South Africa, with the participation of around 150 stakeholders eager to use the cutting-edge facility.

_mLab_ Southern Africa’s activities are aimed at making the region a global hub for mobile innovations that will boost job-led growth and tackle economic and social needs. This strategically located facility will draw upon South Africa’s high bandwidth environment and talented pool of expertise with strong connections to the rest of Africa.

The first _mLab_, supporting the East Africa region, opened in Kenya in June 2011 and provides mentoring resources, on-site technical expertise and access to finance.  Drawing on the successful blueprint of the first facility, _mLab_ Southern Africa’s key objective is to scale-up mobile entrepreneurship into sustainable businesses that create jobs and boost local economies. Three more _mLabs_ will open by the end of the year in Armenia, Pakistan and Vietnam and be linked for cross-fertilisation of ideas and innovations.

“We believe that _mLab_ can help us as a start-up mobile developing company to reach heights that we otherwise would not have attained,” says project manager Obakeng Matlhoko of Sowertech, a mobile web developer and one of the companies that will be using _mLab_’s facilities. “We are excited about the international linkages of the _mLab_,” Matlhoko adds.

The _mLab_ Southern Africa fills a void.  Although the region offers an enormous business opportunity in the mobile sector given that mobile penetration is over 100% in South Africa, there are still challenges to creating a sustainable business in this sector.  Competition is stiff, and mobile developers are scarce and expensive. The _mLab_ provides networking and training opportunities, support for the development of a viable business model, mentoring, subsidised office space, and technical and financial support. These services are aimed at helping the mobile entrepreneur navigate the vulnerable start-up phase, which is when most fledgling efforts flounder.

Thabo Mofolo of Bamboo Computing Services will be using the _mLab_ for the development of BusBuddy, a mobile application that allows users to consult bus schedules for specific routes. “The assistance of the _mLab_ to entrepreneurs in the development of their business model and also the experience the _mLab_ team brings in successfully implementing reputable projects, is of great added value,” says Mofolo.

While the region’s _mLab_ hub is in Pretoria, a number of satellite offices are planned throughout the region, including in Cape Town.  In the months leading up to the official launch, _mLab_ Southern Africa has already run training events in Pretoria and in Cape Town, servicing over 80 _mLab_ members.

_mLab_ Southern Africa is co-hosted by CSIR Meraka Institute, The Innovation Hub, InnovationLab and Ungana-Afrika. Financial support is provided by the South African Department of Science and Technology (DST) and _info_Dev, a World Bank Group global program focusing on supporting technology-driven small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).  _mLabs_ are a result of the private – public partnership entitled _Creating_ _Sustainable Businesses in the Knowledge Economy_ between the government of Finland, Nokia, and _info_Dev &#x2F; World Bank. The aim of the program is to encourage innovation and competitiveness among SMEs in the information and communication technologies and agribusiness sectors in particular.
