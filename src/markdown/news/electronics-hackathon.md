<h4 style="color: #606060 !important;">Organised and Managed in Partnership with mLab Southern Africa and Geekulcha Electronics</h4>
<p style="color: #606060;">Innovation Live 2015, the definitive innovation conference for private and public sector organisations in South Africa offering the latest innovation capability essentials and solutions, will also bring you a Hackathon that is managed and organised in partnership with mLab Southern Africa and Geekulcha Electronics. This hack will be focused on electronics and some of the features, such as the Intel Galileo Board and Raspberry Piâ€™s, to name just a few, which will be used at the helm of the various challenges presented to the participants.</p>
<p style="color: #606060;">This intense 48-hour Hackathon will happen at the 2-day conference and the various applications will be associated with social awareness and real-life solutions to electronic challenges that most ICT and IT organisations face.<br />
A little perspective to what the main features will include is as follows:</p>
<ul style="color: #606060;">
<li><strong>Intel Galileo Board</strong>: This is a microcontroller board based on an Intel application processor that was designed to be hardware and software pin compatible with Arduino Shields.</li>
<li><strong>Raspberry Piâ€™s:</strong> These are low-cost, credit card-sized computers that plug into computer monitors/ TVâ€™s. They use a standard key board and mouse. A Raspberry Pi is a device that enables people to explore computing, and learn how to program in various languages like Scratch and Python. The Raspberry Pi is capable of doing everything you would expect a desktop computer to do, from browsing the internet and playing high-definition video, to making spreadsheets, word processing, and playing games. The Raspberry Pi also has the ability to interact with the outside world, and has been used in a wide array of digital maker projects.</li>
</ul>
