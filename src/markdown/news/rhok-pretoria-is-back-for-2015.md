Random Hacks of Kindness (RHOK) Pretoria is back and will be taking  
place at the UNISA Main campus on the 6th till the 7th of June. Hackers  
from across the province will gather together to hack social-relevant  
solutions that impact Africa as a continent. The theme for this  
edition of RHOK Pretoria is “Socio-Economical Africa”. RHOK is one of  
UNISA's social development programmes for community engagement.  
  
Participants will be hacking and solving challenges that impact the  
community including street innovation, Mozambique, the Northern Cape  
Augmented Reality apps and others. Organizers of RHOK call on all  
social innovators to submit their social relevant ideas to  
[info@geekulcha.com](mailto:info@geekulcha.com).  
  
This year, RHOK will host The Hook Up Dinner on a Saturday night that  
will connect hackers to the entrepreneurs. Winners of RHOK get to  
speak at Tech4Africa and we (MLab Southern Africa) will be sponsoring the category for best  
mobile app idea.  
  
RHOK is brought to you in partnership with mLab Southern Africa, The Innovation Hub, City of  
Tshwane, Intel, Geekulcha, The Hook Up Dinner,  
Google Developer Groups Pretoria, SAINE and Tech4Africa, making sure  
that innovators are given as many platforms as possible to take their innovations forward.  
  
As a build-up to the Geekulcha Hackathon happening 26-28 June, RHOK  
will host 60 developers from a different skills set will a hope that  
everyone will gain new knowledge at the end.  
  
RHOK Pretoria is highly anticipated and had all tickets were allocated in the first  
19 hours. We are looking forward to having some really cool solutions coming  
out of RHOK 2015 so let's hack for social good.
