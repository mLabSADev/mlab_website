Join QDevNet on September 5, 2012 to learn about the current state of mobile web app development and take a deep dive into one of the main areas of HTML5, device APIs.

We will review the significance of device APIs, by conducting a code walk-through and demos of the HTML5 mobile device APIs from Qualcomm, including Camera, File System, Screen Orientation Lock and Audio Input, and showcase what they enable in web apps.

Additionally, we will discuss the various mobile web app debugging tools available, including:

*   Desktop (with emulation) + Web Inspector
*   Chrome on Android Remote Web Inspector
*   Weinre
*   JavaScript Console
