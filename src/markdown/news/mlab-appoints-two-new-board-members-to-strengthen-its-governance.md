Mobile Applications Laboratory (mLab), a leading public benefit organisation that empowers South Africa’s unemployed youth with advanced digital skills and entrepreneurial support, announces a significant step towards promoting diversity and strengthening governance through the appointment of two new board members.

In a bid to reinforce the organisation's commitment to ethical leadership, inclusivity and gender diversity, mLab has welcomed two accomplished professionals to their board.  The addition of these individuals brings invaluable expertise and a fresh perspective to the strategic direction of the business.

Ms Makhosazane Luthuli is a serial entrepreneur and the founder of Allegro Enterprises, a Pan-African consulting firm headquartered in Johannesburg.  A Chartered Accountant by profession, she has experience working in JSE-listed companies and SMEs.  She maintains a keen interest in academia having lectured Accounting and Financial Management at various South African Universities.  With her passion for commercialising innovative business concepts that solve societal problems and empower African women entrepreneurs, Makhosazane is eager to contribute her visionary ideas to advance mLab’s mission.

The second appointee, Ms Lusani Nelufule-Mugivhi is an admitted Attorney of the High Court of South Africa and currently serves as Head of Compliance and Governance for Discovery Health Medical Scheme.  With almost 2 decades in the legal profession, she has vast experience in Legislative Compliance, Corporate law and Governance, and has a strong passion for Privacy and Intellectual Property law.  As a certified Ethics Professional, Lusani joins the board as an advocate for promoting socio-economic development and empowering underrepresented communities. 

"We are thrilled to welcome Ms. Luthuli and Ms Nelufule-Mugivhi to our board of directors," says Laurens Cloete, Chairperson and one of the founding members of mLab.  "Their expertise and commitment to empowering diverse communities, particularly the youth, align perfectly with our organisation's core values.  Their contributions will be instrumental in shaping our strategic direction and expanding our positive impact in the digital skills and enterprise development landscape”, he adds.

Ms. Luthuli and Ms Nelufule-Mugivhi join Laurens Cloete, an Electrical Engineer, Rudi von Staden, a Computer Scientist, Pieter Holl, an Advocate, and Nicoli Koorbanally, a technology innovation professional and CEO, on the mLab board.  

The appointment of these accomplished women reflects mLab’s dedication to creating an inclusive and equitable environment, where diverse voices are recognized, respected, and empowered.  

The mLab team looks forward to the new board playing a pivotal role in fostering an environment of innovation, collaboration, and sustainable growth for the organisation.
