<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is one of the greatest days of 2022 for Landezwa Natu, she says it is a big achievement for her to be a Codetribe Academy graduate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natu says there were moments when she wanted to quit the programme because it was overwhelming. She comes from a background of little knowledge about Programming but has always had an interest in the industry. “Being here today feels amazing, I now have something to show that  I was doing over the 9 months”, Natu added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Natu wishes to be one of the women who create safe spaces for women in the technology industry. “This industry is intimidating and competitive but I want women to be confident about the work they do in the industry”, said Natu. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before joining the Codetribe Academy, Natu was unemployed. She had a small business which did not grow as she wanted, due to the Covid-19 national lockdown. Now that she has graduated, she looks forward to finding a stable job and exploring the STEM industry. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many times Oratile felt like quitting</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oratile Prince Rapoo, a young man hailing from Rustenberg also graduated on this day. When Rapoo joined the Codetribe Academy, he wanted to upskill himself in mobile app development. ‘I found the programme very helpful’, said Rapoo. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rapoo highlighted that being at Codetribe helped him gain an ability which is hard for most people to practice: self-discipline. “It feels good to be graduating today because there are many times when I felt like quitting, this is truly rewarding”, he said. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He says he would advise anyone who wants to upskill themselves in mobile app development to apply to be at Codetribe Academy. He asserts that the programme will help them gain practical skills and become market-ready. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rapoo has his own registered company, which focuses on website and mobile app development. He hopes to find employment to gain momentum and the agency to embark on his business endeavours. </span></p>
