Held in the beautiful town of East London it proved to be a veritable mecca of business contacts and liaisons. The AMA stall proved to be a hive of activity as the team was inundated with information requests on the Awards and Festival events. Africa welcomed the event to be held next year with open arms, it truly was a humbling experience for the AMA team. The line-up of guests who came through the stand was quite varied and this offered us the opportunity to discuss the developmental and cross industry capabilities of mobile. Our thanks go out to all who took the time to meet us and discuss the mobile sector of Africa and its future. We are grateful for all the inputs and have taken them under advisement.&#8221;</p>
