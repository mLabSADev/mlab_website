<p style="color: #444444;"><a href="http://vmob.me/DE1Q15mLab">Take the Survey</a></p>
<p style="color: #444444;">Welcome to the 8th Developer Economics survey &#8211; the largest, most global research series on the app economy and developer trends, tracking responses from thousands of developers across the globe. <strong>If you&#8217;re involved in mobile app, IoT or backend infrastructure development, take the latest survey and tell us what you think about the latest dev trends</strong> &#8211; Do you see more opportunity in Wearables, Smart Homes or Connected Cars? Who&#8217;s making money from apps &#8211; and how? Are iOS developers adopting Swift? Is the web vs. native debate still relevant?</p>
<p style="color: #444444;">Take the 10-minute survey and talk mobile &amp; IoT trends &#8211; and win some great prizes while you&#8217;re at it! <strong>The results of this survey will become available as a research report in February &#8211; and will be available as a FREE download</strong>. To check out the latest report published, and get an idea to what you&#8217;re contributing to, visit www.DeveloperEconomics.com</p>
