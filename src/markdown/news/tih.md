<p>The headquarters of the mLab Southern Africa (SA) will be based at <a href="http://www.theinnovationhub.com/">The Innovation Hub</a> in Tshwane, South Africa. The Innovation Hub was a natural selection for the location of the mLab SA for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is a science park with a strong focus on innovation.</li>
<li>It is home to the <a href="http://www.theinnovationhub.com/maxum.cfm">Maxum Business Incubator</a>, which can offer support services to mLab incubatees.</li>
<li>It is in close proximity to the <a href="http://www.csir.co.za/meraka/">Meraka Institute</a>, which has a strong mobile development and research focus (and is also a consortium member of mLab SA).</li>
<li>It is in close proximity to the <a href="http://www.dst.gov.za/">Department of Science and Technology</a>, and many national government departments based in Tshwane. The mLab SA plans to include mobile government in its work.</li>
</ul>
<p>The mLab SA plans to open its doors to members some time in July.</p>
