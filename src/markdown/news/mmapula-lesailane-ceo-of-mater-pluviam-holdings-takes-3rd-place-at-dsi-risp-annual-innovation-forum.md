Mmapula Lesailane, CEO of Mater Pluviam Holdings, recently achieved a significant milestone by securing 3rd place at the Department of Science and Innovation’s (DSI) Regional Innovation Support Programme (RISP) Annual Regional Innovation Forum held at the CSIR International Convention Centre on 16 - 17 July. RISP is hosted by the CSIR’s Hosted National Programmes Unit.

Mmapula won a prize of R25,000 in the form of a voucher towards Technology Development Support (TDS), Intellectual Property Support (IPS), or Market Access Support (MAS). These will help her business grow and develop its innovations.

"Participating in the RISP Innovation Forum was an exhilarating and enriching experience. It was a fantastic platform to showcase Mater Pluviam Holdings' innovations and network with other forward-thinking professionals. Winning 3rd place was a proud moment for us, as it validated our efforts and provided recognition for the hard work our team has put in.” Mmapula shared.

Mater Pluviam Holdings focuses on developing sustainable solutions for agriculture, particularly in enhancing biofertilizers and integrating advanced technologies for soil health monitoring. Their commitment to innovation will be further bolstered by the support prize from RISP, which they plan to utilise towards their training centre and implementing a biogas system.

"Our future plans for Mater Pluviam include expanding our reach to more farmers, enhancing our biofertilizer products, and integrating more advanced technologies for soil health monitoring. Our current needs include refurbishing our training centre and installation of a biogas system. We are hoping to leverage RISP support to enable this. This will not only improve our training facilities but also demonstrate sustainable energy and fertiliser practices to our clients. Additionally, we are currently working on an incubation program starting in September and would welcome any form of support or collaboration to help us bring more change to the farmers. The prize is a stepping stone towards greater innovation and impact in the agriscience sector, supporting our mission of helping farmers commercialise and access global markets," she outlined.

AgriTourZA, one of the Regional Innovation Networking Platforms supported by the Regional Innovation Support Programme hosted by the CSIR, is implemented by mLab in the Limpopo province, and has played a pivotal role in Mater Pluviam's journey. AgriTourZA focuses on driving agricultural and tourism innovation, providing valuable insights and a network that has shaped Mater Pluviam's business strategy.

"Our journey with AgriTourZA has been transformative. It provided us with valuable insights, especially on the importance of agri-tourism in promoting local agriculture. Through AgriTourZA, we’ve built a network of like-minded individuals and organisations that share our vision. It has reinforced our commitment to creating solutions that are not only innovative but also environmentally responsible and beneficial to the farming community," Mmapula reflected.

Mmapula Lesailane's success at the RISP Annual Regional Innovation Forum not only highlights her dedication to sustainable agricultural practices but also underscores Mater Pluviam Holdings' potential to make a significant impact in the agriscience sector. 

As they continue to innovate and expand their reach, supported by the Regional Innovation Support Programme (RISP), their journey promises to bring transformative change to local farming communities.
