In 2014 Cape Town will become the **World Design Capital**, taking over the reins from Helsinki.

_“With more than half the world’s population now living in urban areas, design has become an increasingly fundamental tool to make cities more competitive, attractive, liveable and efficient. The World Design Capital designation is a city promotion project that celebrates the accomplishments of cities that have used design as a tool to reinvent themselves and improve social, cultural and economic life.” International Council of Societies of Industrial Design (Icsid)_

**Helsinki**, **Nokia South Africa** and **Microsoft** is celebrating Cape Town’s selection as World Design Capital for 2014 by launching **the Urban App Challenge** in partnership with **AppCampus**, the **Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland** and **mLab Southern Africa**.
