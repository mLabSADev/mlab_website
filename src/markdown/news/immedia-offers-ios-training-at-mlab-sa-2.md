<p>From 7-9 October <a href="http://www.immedia.co.za/">immedia</a>, a mobile development house based in Durban and a Gold member of the mLab, offered a 3-day <a href="http://www.immedia.co.za/courses/appdev.html#iosadvanced">Advanced iOS training course</a> at the mLab offices in Pretoria.</p>
<p>Eight people from the company Gijima-SA attended the course, which was delivered by a specialist iOS trainer from Switzerland, <a href="http://www.immedia.co.za/courses/trainers.html">Adrian Kosmaczewski</a>. He has been writing (and teaching) software for the past 20 years and is an expert in iOS and Android apps.</p>
<p>Selene Shah, head of Talent Development at immedia, was very pleased with the collaboration with the mLab. “Our training course went exceptionally well last week, in no small part to the wonderful support and assistance from mLab. The venue and facilities turned out to be ideal for such an event,” she said.</p>
<p>immedia will be offering more training at the mLab in the future. <a href="http://eepurl.com/c7qD6">Sign up</a> to our newsletter to stay informed of upcoming training.</p>
