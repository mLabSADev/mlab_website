<p><strong>What was your Experience?</strong></p>
<p>The two day Tech Demo has been a wonderful eye opening experience. As Jatamobile we have been afford an opportunity to interact with other &#8220;players&#8221; in the African ICT sector. The demo presentations were very informative and gave us insights into how we can adjust operations going forward, especially in the data management area. It was great to speak on a level playing field with large firms not normally easily accessible and this has given us valuable new contacts as we plan and execute the African Mobile Awards. On the whole the Tech Demo was a well appreciated experience, an eye opener and motivating experience.</p>
<p><strong>What have you learned?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Attending the demo sessions taught us the different ways of presenting information and ways of engaging the audience. The content in the sessions was a wealth of knowledge as we learnt valuable lessons on managing operations in terms of aspects like data security and advantages of employing cloud computing among st others. We also learnt the importance of networking as through this process our firm could be exposed to expertise we could employ to streamline operations. Another lesson we learnt was the vastness of the ICT sector in Africa and that mobile had the significance of being able to work across sector platforms and benefit them all. The panel discussions gave us the opportunity to hear from industry expects their views on issues affecting the industry on a local scale and globally.</p>

<p><a href="http://za.linkedin.com/in/derrickkotze/">Derrick Kotze</a>, CEO of mlab Southern Africa said &#8220;Events like these, that open op the stage for smaller tech start-ups to present their innovations with the likes of Intel, Samsung and SAS, are incredibly important. It allows young entrepreneurs not only to practice their &#8220;pitching&#8221; but also builds their confidence and gives their products a much needed mindshare boost. I hope to see more mainstream events creating such opportunities as part of their general agendas. A big thank you to IT News Africa and The Innovation Hub for organizing the event and inviting our members.&#8221;</p>
