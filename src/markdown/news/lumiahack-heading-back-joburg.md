<p>In March mLabSA, Nokia and Microsoft hit the road looking for South Africa&#8217;s best young Mobile Developers. The journey kicked off in Port Elizabeth, Cape Town, Durban and Johannesburg with epic 48 hour Hackathons and workshops in each city with the aim of training and inspiring student developers to build some cool apps for the new Nokia Lumia range.</p>
<p>Now almost four months and hundreds of development hours later the legendary #LumiaHack returns to Jo&#8217;burg this weekend, 22 &#8211; 24 June 2012, for its finale to crown not only South Africa&#8217;s best student developer and University but with it open to all developers you now have a chance to win the Best Lumia Dev title and some seriously awesome prizes. <strong>The winner will walk away with an AlienWare PC, Kinect for PC, a new Nokia Lumia, Nokia Purity Headset and an all expenses paid trip to Microsoft Tech-Ed 2013!</strong></p>
