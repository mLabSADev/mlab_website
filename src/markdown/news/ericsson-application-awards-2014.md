App-development Competition for students and small &amp; medium  
sized enterprises.**What is the Ericsson App Awards?**The market for smartphone applications, or apps, has exploded over the past few years. This started, more or less, with the introduction of the iPhone and has been complemented by the advent of the open-source Android mobile operating system. At Ericsson, we are always keen to understand how our communication equipment and services are used by the end users. Therefore we started Ericsson Application Awards – a competition where talented developers, top students and entrepreneurs have a chance to show what they can do and what ideas they have.

**Ericsson Application Awards 2014**

This is the fifth consecutive year that Ericsson has run the contest. Students and small- and medium-sized enterprises from anywhere in the world are invited to submit Android and OS apps.

This competition will give the opportunity to gain a foothold in the app industry while also earning recognition and making contacts within the telecom industry.

The theme for this year is “Working Life.” It is about creating ways to connect people, things and places to empower individuals, society and enterprises. How can mobility, the cloud, applications and services improve our working life? Can apps help people innovate, collaborate and balance life outside work? We are open to suggestions.

The awards for each category (Students and Companies) are as follows:

First prize: EUR 25 000

Second prize: EUR 10 000

Third to tenth prize: diplomas, honorary mentions

Technology for Good award
