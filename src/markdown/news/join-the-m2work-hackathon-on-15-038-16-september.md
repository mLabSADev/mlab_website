To bring mobile microwork ideas to life and to support aspiring mobile entrepreneurs in their efforts to establish sustainable businesses, we’ll be organizing, with the support of infoDev, a global m2Work Hackathon along with four other countries on September 15-16, 2012. At the event, talented innovators will have the chance to connect with developers and build working prototypes that will appeal to the local market.

Earlier this year, infoDev and Nokia launched the [m2Work Challenge](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.infodev.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;Article.842.html), which yielded almost 1000 ideas on how to create jobs that people could do from many of the [five billion active mobile phones in developing countries](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.infodev.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;Article.873.html).

The next phase is to bring those ideas to life. Several challenge winners are already deep in talks with national governments, angel investors, and fellow developers on how to improve and distribute their apps. To help the larger m2Work community turn their ideas into mobile microwork businesses, infoDev and its global partners are organizing the [m2Work Hackathon](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.m2workhackathon.org&#x2F;) in five sites around the world.  
****  
The m2Work Hackathon aims to:****

1.  Shape promising idea submissions into mobile application prototypes;
2.  Bolster other prototype mobile microwork applications that qualify for pre-incubation support at infoDev’s Mobile Application Labs (mLabs), and
3.  Increase awareness for [the job-creating potential of mobile microwork](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bbc.com&#x2F;future&#x2F;story&#x2F;20120601-money-making-mobiles) in developing countries.
