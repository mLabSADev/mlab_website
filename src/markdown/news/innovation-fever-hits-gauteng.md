Spring is finally in the air and that means its time to get those brains out of hibernation!

If you are looking for a good reason to unleash your awesome creativity and brain power then you cant beat the opportunity to win your share of R1 million at this year’s Gauteng Innovation Competition.

[The Gauteng Innovation Competition](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;gic.theinnovationhub.com) (GIC) is an initiative of The Innovation Hub, Gauteng Growth and Development Agency, and Gauteng Department of Economic Development. The 2011 edition of the competition attracted more than 130 entries and over R1 million in prize money was awarded.

This year the competition is looking for innovations that address key service delivery challenges in the province within two themes; mobile and green technologies. Municipalities and key sector stakeholders have assisted us in identifying seven high priority opportunities within the two themes.

@mlabsa is again a proud partner in the **mobile category** and we are looking for innovative mobile solutions to assist with:

*   _**Citizen participation.**_ Municipalities are looking for better ways to communicate with the citizens they serve. How can mobile phones be used to enhance interaction between public officials and citizens within the province?
*   _**Transport and traffic management.**_ Gauteng has very high traffic volumes and a rapidly expanding public transport network. How can mobile phones be used to reduce congestion and improve the performance of public transport?
*   _**Community safety.**_ The Gauteng Provincial Government and municipalities are striving to reduce the levels of crime in the province. Do you have an idea for an app that can contribute to a safer, more secure society?

There is a total of R1 million in prize money for the competition, which will be divided between the two themes (Mobile &amp; Green). To be eligible for a prize, you will need to submit a concept which addresses one or more of the focus areas highlighted above. Concepts need to show innovation in the technology being used, the application of the technology, or the proposed business model. For more on what is required to enter the competition, see the [Competition Rules](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;gic.theinnovationhub.com&#x2F;participation&#x2F;rules&#x2F; &quot;Competition Rules&quot;), [Prizes and Adjudication](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;gic.theinnovationhub.com&#x2F;participation&#x2F;prizes&#x2F; &quot;Prizes and Adjudication&quot;), and [FAQ](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;gic.theinnovationhub.com&#x2F;participation&#x2F;faq&#x2F; &quot;FAQ&quot;) pages.
