mLab will be hosting an Internationalization workshop and GeekExchange on 17 January at The Innovation Hub in Pretoria. We kick off at 10:30am and will be running a number of interactive exchanges and a Pitch-ionary (pitching game) until 2pm.

As apps mature in your local market it becomes important to build a clear and executable strategy to venture into new markets. Join us as we cover some of the important considerations, look at some case studies, hear from some start-ups who have made the first steps to internationalize and come play our pitching game.

We have limited space left for this first workshop so please apply to participate by emailing [Rulani@mlab.co.za](mailto:rulani@mlab.co.za) Â by 13 January.
