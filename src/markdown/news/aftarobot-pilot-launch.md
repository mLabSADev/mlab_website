<p style="text-align: justify;">Yesterday saw the launch of a pilot program to modernize the local taxi industry through mobile technology.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://mlab/aftarobot/">Sowertech</a> in partnership with the Alexandra, Randburg, Midrand and Sandton Taxi Association (ARMSTA) officially launched a range of mobile services for commuters as well as the enterprise side of the association at an event held in Alexandra.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While location based technology is nothing new, many of the estimated 40 million daily commuters still do not own devices with GPS and as such the team from Sowertech developed AftaRobot to provide smart commuter services through USSD and smart apps.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The pilot is the first phase of rolling out the services nationally and across Africa and will initially focus on 2 routes within the Johannesburg region.</p>
