<p>Swift Livestock [<a href="https://swiftlivestock.co.za/">https://swiftlivestock.co.za/</a>] now known as SwiftVee has been selected as 1 of 12 startups across the continent to participate in Google&#8217;s Lauchpad Accelerator Africa programme. This makes them the only South African team selected. The bootcamp kicked-off in Lagos Nigeria and will continue to Nairobi, Kenya next month.</p>
<h2>From mLab Accelerator programme to Google Launchpad Africa</h2>
<p>Swift Vee began their journey in disrupting the livestock trading industry in 2017; as fund recipients of the mLab &#8211; TIA App fund. The goal of the App Fund is to help innovative startups accelerate product and business development. They have as a result developed the Swift Live Stock App available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apphouse.swiftlivestock">android</a>  and<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/swiftvee/id1291771639?ls=1&amp;mt=8"> Apple iOS</a>. The Swift Live Stock App&#8217;s goal is to facilitate the trading of livestock which in turn addresses food security and water scarcity in line with UN&#8217;s Millennium Development Goal 1: <em>Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger</em>.</p>
