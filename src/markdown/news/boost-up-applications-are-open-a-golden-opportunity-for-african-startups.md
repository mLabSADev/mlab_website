If you're an entrepreneur in Africa looking to take your startup to the next level, the Boost Up programme is here to help. Organised by the Southern Africa Innovation Collective (SAIC), this exciting initiative is available in Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, and Zambia. It's designed to support startups that use technology and innovation to tackle societal challenges, giving them the skills and exposure needed to pitch their ideas and attract investment.

**What Is Boost Up?**

Boost Up is a three-part startup support programme that includes a Set Up training, Stand Up pitch competitions, and the Scale Up training. Here's a breakdown of what each part offers:

**Set Up**

The Set Up phase is all about helping you polish your business idea. You'll learn practical tools to package your concept and develop a compelling pitch that speaks directly to your target market. The Set Up training sessions are held separately in each Boost Up country, ensuring that local entrepreneurs get the tailored support they need.

**Stand Up Pitch Competitions**

Once you've completed the Set Up training, it's time to Stand Up and shine. Startups that are serious about making an impact, have a scalable business model, and want to attract investment will compete in national pitch competitions in their respective countries. Around 10 startups per country will be selected to pitch at these events. A panel of expert judges will then choose the top startups to move forward to interviews. The most promising startups, two from each country, will be invited to join the Boost Up Scale Up incubator.

**Scale Up Incubation Programme**

The final phase, Scale Up, is where the real growth happens. This incubation programme is for impact-driven startups that are ready to become more investable. It includes an online incubation phase and a hands-on Bootcamp in Botswana.

**Who Should Apply?**

You should consider applying for Boost Up if:

* Your startup is a registered business in Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, or Zambia.
* Your business model uses technology and innovation to address a societal challenge in Southern Africa.
* You have a scalable business model.
* You're working on a prototype or already have one ready.
* You or your startup have not won a South African Innovation Summit (SAIS) national pitch competition or participated in previous Boost Up Bootcamps, the Slush Global Impact Accelerator 2018, or been sponsored by SAIS to participate in Slush 2017.

This is your chance to take your startup to new heights. Apply now for the Boost Up programme and set your business on the path to success.
