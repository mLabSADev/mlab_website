**CHALLENGER DIGITAL and GREEN ACCELERATOR PROGRAMME** 



### CONTEXT 

The climate crisis and sustainability of the planet is no longer a distant threat. It is a current reality affecting ecosystems, economies and everyday life across the globe. From heatwaves and erratic rainfall to rising sea-levels and loss of biodiversity, the planet is sounding alarms that cannot be ignored. In Southern Africa, these shifts are particularly stark: droughts are deepening, food systems are under threat, and vulnerable communities are bearing the brunt. 

This dire situation demands urgent action and development of innovative solutions to address these critical challenges. Consequently, the Challenger Digital and Green Accelerator Programme (Challenger D&G) aims to catalyse the development of digital, green, and circular innovations that address pressing environmental and socio-economic challenges in support of: 



● Climate adaptation and resilience 

● Food security and sustainable agriculture 

● Water conservation and renewable energy solutions 

● Urban mobility and waste management 



In response to the European Union’s Multi-Donor “Digital and Green Innovation Action” initiative, Challenger D&G will support up to 25 high-potential startups working at the intersection of technology, sustainability, and social impact. To qualify, startups must address at least one green transition objective (e.g. climate adaptation, circular economy, biodiversity protection) and be classified as sustainable, green or circular businesses (or enterprises), defined as follows: 



● Sustainable businesses focus on reducing the negative impact of their operations on the environment and people in society. 

● Green businesses provide commercial solutions to environmental challenges that are economically viable and often socially empowering. 

● Circular businesses focus on creating a closed-loop system where resources are reused and recycled to minimise waste and maximise resource efficiency while eliminating or minimising the use of toxic, non-biodegradable chemicals and relying on renewable energy. 

## Strategic Focus Areas 

Challenger D&G has prioritised innovative solutions in the following focus areas:
