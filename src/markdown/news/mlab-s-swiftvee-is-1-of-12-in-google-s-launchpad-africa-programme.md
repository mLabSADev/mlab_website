From mLab Accelerator programme to Google Launchpad Africa
----------------------------------------------------------

Swift Vee began their journey in disrupting the livestock trading industry in 2017; as fund recipients of the mLab TIA App fund. The goal of the App Fund is to help innovative startups accelerate product and business development. They have as a result developed the Swift Live Stock App available on [android](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id&#x3D;com.apphouse.swiftlivestock)  and [Apple iOS](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itunes.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;swiftvee&#x2F;id1291771639?ls&#x3D;1&amp;mt&#x3D;8). TheÂ Swift Live Stock App's goal is to facilitate the trading of livestock which in turn addresses food security and water scarcity in line with UN's Millennium Development Goal 1: _Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger_.
