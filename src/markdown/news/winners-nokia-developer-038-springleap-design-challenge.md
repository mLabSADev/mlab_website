A couple of weeks back we reported on an [innovative competition](https:&#x2F;&#x2F;mlab.co.za&#x2F;nokia-calls-designers-pimp-devs&#x2F;) Nokia was running in partnership with local design startup [Springleap.com](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.springleap.com).

Nokia put a bounty out for an awesome design they could use on their t-shirts as part of a way to thank and ‚Äúpimp‚Äù their developer community.

Well the designs were submitted, the public voted and the top 3 designs were selected. Check out the winning designs [here!](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.springleap.com&#x2F;posts&#x2F;view&#x2F;nokia-pimp-our-devs-winners-announced)

We love the inspirational quote from the winning designer:

‚ÄúUnfortunately, developers are often overlooked despite the fact that we use products they have created every day. With this in mind, I conceptualised the Nokia devs as ninjas, working and building awesome stuff behind the scenes.‚Äù

Here‚Äôs to all the Ninjas out there üôÇ
