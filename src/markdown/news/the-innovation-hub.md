The headquarters of the mLab Southern Africa (SA) will be based at [The Innovation Hub](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theinnovationhub.com&#x2F;) in Tshwane, South Africa. The Innovation Hub was a natural selection for the location of the mLab SA for a number of reasons:

*   It is a science park with a strong focus on innovation.
*   It is home to the [Maxum Business Incubator](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theinnovationhub.com&#x2F;maxum.cfm), which can offer support services to mLab incubatees.
*   It is in close proximity to the [Meraka Institute](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.csir.co.za&#x2F;meraka&#x2F;), which has a strong mobile development and research focus (and is also a consortium member of mLab SA).
*   It is in close proximity to the [Department of Science and Technology](http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.dst.gov.za&#x2F;), and many national government departments based in Tshwane. The mLab SA plans to include mobile government in its work.

The mLab SA plans to open its doors to members some time in July.
